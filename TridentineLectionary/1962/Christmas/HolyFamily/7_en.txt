We offer unto Thee, O Lord, this 
propitiatory Sacrifice, humbly entreating
Thee: that through the intercession of 
the Virgin Mother of God, with blessed 
Joseph, Thou wouldst firmly establish 
our families in Thy peace and grace. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
