When Jesus was twelve years old, they
going up into Jerusalem according to 
the custom of the feast, and having 
fulfilled the days, when they returned, 
the Child Jesus remained in Jerusalem,
and His parents knew it not. And 
thinking that He was in the company, 
they came a day's journey, and sought 
Him among their kinsfolk and 
acquaintances. And not finding Him, 
they returned into Jerusalem, seeking 
Him. And it came to pass that after 
three days they found Him in the 
Temple, sitting in the midst of the 
doctors, hearing them and asking them 
questions. And all that heard Him were 
astonished at His wisdom and His 
answers. And seeing Him they 
wondered. And His Mother said to Him:
Son, why hast Thou done so to us? 
Behold Thy father and I have sought 
Thee sorrowing. And He said to them: 
how is it that you sought Me? Did you 
not know that I must be about My 
Father's business? And they 
understood not the word that He spoke 
unto them. And he went down with 
them and came to Nazareth, and was 
subject to them. And His Mother kept 
all these words in her heart. And Jesus 
advanced in wisdom and age and 
grace with God and men.
