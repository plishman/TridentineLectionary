Make us, O Lord Jesus, whom Thou 
dost refresh with heavenly sacraments,
ever to follow the example of Thy Holy 
Family: that in the hour of our death, 
the glorious Virgin Thy Mother with 
blessed Joseph may come to our aid, 
and we may be found worthy to be 
received by Thee into everlasting 
tabernacles. Who lives and reigns, with
God the Father, in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
