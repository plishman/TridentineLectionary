The father of the just rejoices greatly, 
let Thy father and Thy mother be joyful,
and let her rejoice who bore Thee. (Ps. 
88: 2-3) How lovely are Thy 
tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts! My soul 
longs and faints for the courts of the 
Lord. V. Glory be to the Father and to 
the Son and to the Holy Spirit. As it was
in the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. The 
father of the just rejoices greatly, let 
Thy father and Thy mother be joyful, 
and let her rejoice who bore Thee.
