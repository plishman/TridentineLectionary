O Lord Jesus Christ, who, being 
subject to Mary and Joseph, didst 
sanctify home life with unspeakable 
virtues: grant, that, by the aid of both, 
we may be taught by the example of 
Thy Holy Family, and attain to eternal 
fellowship with it: Who lives and reigns,
with God the Father, in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever, and ever.
