While all things were in quiet silence, 
and the night was in the midst of her 
course, Thine almighty Word, O Lord, 
leaped down from heaven from Thy 
royal throne. (Ps. 92: 1) The Lord hath 
reigned, He is clothed with beauty: the 
Lord is clothed with strength, and hath 
girded Himself. V. Glory be to the 
Father and to the Son and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now
and ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen. While all things were in quiet 
silence, and the night was in the midst 
of her course, Thine almighty Word, O 
Lord, leaped down from heaven from 
Thy royal throne.
