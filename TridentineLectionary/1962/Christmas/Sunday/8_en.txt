Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the offering made in the sight
of Thy Majesty may obtain for us the 
grace of loving devotion, and the 
reward of a blessed eternity. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
