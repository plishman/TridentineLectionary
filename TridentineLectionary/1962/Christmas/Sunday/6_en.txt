At that time Joseph and Mary, the 
mother of Jesus, were wondering at 
those things which were spoken 
concerning Him, And Simeon blessed 
them, and said to Mary His Mother: 
Behold this child is set for the fall and 
for the resurrection of many in Israel: 
and for a sign which shall be 
contradicted: and thine own soul a 
sword shall pierce, that out of many 
hearts thoughts may be revealed. And 
there was one Anna a prophetess, the 
daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of 
Aser. She was far advanced in years, 
and had lived with her husband seven 
years from her virginity. And she was a 
widow until fourscore and four years: 
who departed not from the temple, by 
fastings and prayers serving night and 
day. Now she, at the same hour, 
coming in, confessed to the Lord: and 
spoke of Him to all that looked for the 
redemption of Israel. And after they had
performed all things according to the 
law of the Lord, they returned into 
Galilee, to the city of Nazareth. And the
Child grew and waxed strong, full of 
wisdom: and the grace of God was in 
Him.
