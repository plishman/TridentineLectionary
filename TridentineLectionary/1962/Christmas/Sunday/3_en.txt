Brethren, As long as the heir is a child, 
he differs nothing from a servant, 
though he be lord of all: but is under 
tutors and governors until the time 
appointed by the father: so we also, 
when we were children, were serving 
under the elements of the world. But 
when the fullness of the time was 
come, God sent His Son, made of a 
woman, made under the law, that He 
might redeem them who were under 
the law, that we might receive the 
adoption of sons. And because you are
sons, God hath sent the Spirit of His 
Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, 
Father. Therefore now he is not a 
servant, but a son, and if a son, an heir 
also through God.
