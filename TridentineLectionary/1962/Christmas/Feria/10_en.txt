May this communion, O Lord, cleanse 
us from all sin, and by the intercession 
of the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of 
God, make us partakers of the 
heavenly remedy. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
