O God, Who through the fruitful virginity
of blessed Mary didst secure for 
mankind the reward of eternal 
salvation: grant, we beseech Thee, that
we may experience her intercession 
for us, through whom we have been 
made worthy to receive the Author of 
life, our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son: 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
