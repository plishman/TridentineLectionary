O God Who didst appoint Thine only-
begotten Son the Savior of mankind, 
and didst bid that He should be called 
Jesus: mercifully grant that we may 
also enjoy the vision of Him in Heaven 
Whose holy Name we venerate on 
earth. Through the same Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
