In those days: Peter, filled with the Holy
Spirit, said to them: Ye princes of the 
people and ancients, hear: If we this 
day are examined concerning the good 
deed done to the infirm man, by what 
means he hath been made whole, be it 
known to you all, and to all the people 
of Israel, that by the name of our Lord 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you 
crucified, whom God hath raised from 
the dead, even by Him this man 
standeth before you whole. This is the 
stone which was rejected by you the 
builders, which is become the head of 
the corner: neither is there salvation in 
any other. For there is no other Name 
under heaven given to men, whereby 
we must be saved.
