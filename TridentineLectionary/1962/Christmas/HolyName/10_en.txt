O almighty and everlasting God, who 
didst create and redeem us, look 
graciously upon our prayer, and with a 
favorable and benign countenance 
deign to accept the Sacrifice of the 
saving Victim, which we have offered to
Thy Majesty in honor of the name of 
Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: that 
through the infusion of Thy grace we 
may rejoice that our names are written 
in heaven, under the glorious name of 
Jesus, the pledge of eternal 
predestination. Through the same Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
