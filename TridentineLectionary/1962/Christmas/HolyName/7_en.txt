May Thy blessing, by which all 
creatures live, hallow, we beseech 
Thee, most merciful God, this our 
sacrifice, which we offer to Thee to the 
glory of the name of Thy Son our Lord 
Jesus Christ, that it may please Thy 
majesty and bring Thee praise, and 
avail us unto salvation. Through the 
same Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
