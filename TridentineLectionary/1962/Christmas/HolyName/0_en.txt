In the name of Jesus let every knee 
bow of those that are in heaven, on 
earth, and under the earth; and let 
every tongue confess that the Lord 
Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the 
Father. (Ps. 8: 2) O Lord, our Lord, 
how wonderful is Thy Name in the 
whole earth. Glory be to the Father 
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now and 
ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
In the name of Jesus let every knee 
bow of those that are in heaven, on 
earth, and under the earth; and let 
every tongue confess that the Lord 
Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the 
Father.
