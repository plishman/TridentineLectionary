Accept we pray Thee, O Lord, the gifts 
duly offered to Thee, and, by the 
interceding merits of blessed 
Anastasia, Thy martyr, grant them to 
be profitable for the furtherance of our 
salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
