(Station at St. Anastasia) 
Originally, the stational Mass at St. Anastasia was wholly in honor of the
martyr of that name, but later on, as the feast of Christmas gradually gained in 
importance, that of St. Anastasia dwindled down to a commemorative Collect. 
Under the Diocletian persecution, this holy martyr was burnt alive on this day.
The mystical meaning attached by medieval liturgists to the hour of dawn 
had no foundation in the Roman custom. This Mass draws its chief inspiration 
from the thought of the sun, whose rising already begins to dispel the shades of 
night and leads us to the contemplation of Him who was begotten, Light of Light,
from the bosom of the divine Father before the rising of the day-star. 
Generosity, magnificence. and light, these are always the marks of God's 
handiwork. Sin is generally committed in darkness and in secret, for the wicked 
hate the light, but the Redemption is wrought upon Calvary in sight of the whole 
world, so that all people, through the light of faith, may recognize and adore the 
crucified Savior.
