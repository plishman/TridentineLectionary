Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that we, upon whom is poured 
the new light of Thine Incarnate Word, 
may show forth in our actions that 
brightness which by faith shineth in our 
minds. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
