At that time the shepherds said one to 
another: Let us go over to Bethlehem, 
and let us see this word that is come to 
pass, which the Lord hath showed to 
us. And they came with haste: and they
found Mary and Joseph, and the Infant 
lying in the manger. And seeing they 
understood of the word that had been 
spoken to them concerning this Child. 
And all that heard wondered: and at 
those things that were told them by the
shepherds. But Mary kept all these 
words, pondering them in her heart. 
And the shepherds returned, glorifying 
and praising God for all the things they 
had heard and seen, as it was told unto
them.
