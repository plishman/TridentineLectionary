A light shall shine upon us this day: for 
the Lord is born to us: and He shall be 
called Wonderful, God, the Prince of 
Peace, the Father of the world to 
come: of whose reign there shall be no 
end. (Ps. 92: 1) The Lord hath reigned,
He is clothed with beauty: the Lord is 
clothed with strength, and hath girded 
Himself. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. A 
light shall shine upon us this day: for 
the Lord is born to us: and He shall be 
called Wonderful, God, the Prince of 
Peace, the Father of the world to 
come: of whose reign there shall be no 
end.
