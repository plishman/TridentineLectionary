May our offerings, we beseech Thee, O
Lord, be in keeping with the mysteries 
of this festival of the Nativity, and ever 
pour down upon us peace: that, even 
as He who was born man shone forth 
also as God, so may this earthly 
substance bestow upon us that which 
is divine. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
