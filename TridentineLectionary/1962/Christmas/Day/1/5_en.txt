At that time there went out a decree 
from CÃ¦sar Augustus, that the whole 
world should be enrolled. This 
enrolling was first made by Cyrinus, the
governor of Syria. And all went to be 
enrolled, every one into his own city. 
And Joseph also went up from Galilee 
out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea 
to the city of David, which is called 
Bethlehem: because he was of the 
house and family of David, to be
enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, 
who was with child. And it came to 
pass, that when they were there, her 
days were accomplished that she 
should be delivered. And she brought 
forth her first-born Son, and wrapped 
Him up in swaddling clothes, and laid 
Him in a manger: because there was 
no room for them in the inn. And there 
were in the same country shepherds
watching and keeping the night 
watches over their flock. And behold an
Angel of the Lord stood by them, and 
the brightness of God shone round 
about them, and they feared with a 
great fear. And the Angel said
to them: Fear not; for behold I bring you
good tidings of great joy, that shall be 
to all the people: for this day is born to 
you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, in 
the city of David. And this shall be a 
sign unto you: you shall find the Infant 
wrapped in swaddling clothes, and laid 
in a manger. And suddenly there was 
with the Angel a multitude of the 
heavenly army, praising God, and 
saying: Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace to men of good will.
