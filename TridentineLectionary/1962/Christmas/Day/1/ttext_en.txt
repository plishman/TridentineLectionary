(Station at St. Mary Major - at the Crib)
The feast of Christmas was from the first a feast of the Apostolic See. The
fixation of the date resulted from the separation by the Roman Church of the 
celebration of Our Savior's birth from that of His other great manifestation now
placed on the Epiphany. The characteristic feature of the feast of Christmas in 
the Roman rite is the custom of the three Masses, one at the first cock-crowing, 
the next at dawn, the third in broad daylight. St. Gregory bears witness to the
custom, but it is certainly older than his time, for the biographer of Pope 
Telesphorus, in the Liber Pontificalis, claims that it was this latter Pontiff who first
introduced the singing of the Gloria into the midnight Mass at Christmas.
The Mass at midnight recalls the circumstance that Christ was born in 
Bethlehem at midnight. The midnight Mass commemorates the eternal birth of 
the Word of God amid the magnificence of His Father's glory; the Mass at dawn 
celebrates His appearance in time in the humility of the flesh, and lastly, the third
Mass, at St. Peter's, symbolizes His final coming on the day of judgment, to 
judge both the living and the dead.
In order to reproduce in liturgical form at Rome, as at Jerusalem, the scene 
of the Savior's birth, Pope Sixtus III (432-40) had erected in St. Mary Major a 
sumptuous oratory at the crib, and one which was considered by the Romans to
be a copy of the original at Bethlehem. At the foot of the crib we say to the 
Christ Child in the words of St. Alphonsus -
"Ah, how much it has cost Thee to love us!"
