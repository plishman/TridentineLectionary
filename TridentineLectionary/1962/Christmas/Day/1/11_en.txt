Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord our 
God, that we, who rejoice in 
celebrating these mysteries of the 
Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, may 
by a fitting association be made worthy
to attain to fellowship with Him. Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
