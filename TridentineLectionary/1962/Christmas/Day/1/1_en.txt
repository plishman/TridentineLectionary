O God, who hast made this most holy 
night to shine forth with the brightness 
of the true Light: grant, we beseech 
Thee, that we, who have known the 
mystery of His light on earth, may attain
the enjoyment of His happiness in 
heaven. Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
