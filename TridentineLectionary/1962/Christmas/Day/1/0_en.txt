The Lord hath said to me: Thou art My
Son, this day have I begotten Thee. 
(Ps. 2: 1) Why have the Gentiles 
raged, and the people devised vain 
things? Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
The Lord hath said to me: Thou art My
Son, this day have I begotten Thee.
