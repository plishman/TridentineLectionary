May the oblation of this dayâ€™s festival 
be pleasing to Thee, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord: that of Thy bountiful 
grace ,we may, through this sacred 
intercourse, be found conformed to 
Him, in Whom our substance is united 
to Thee. Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
