A Child is born to us, and a Son is 
given to us: Whose government is upon
His shoulder and His Name shall be 
called the Angel of Great Counsel. (Ps. 
97: 1) Sing ye to the Lord a new 
canticle: for He hath done wonderful 
things. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. A 
Child is born to us, and a Son is given 
to us: Whose government is upon His 
shoulder and His Name shall be called 
the Angel of Great Counsel.
