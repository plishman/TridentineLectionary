(Station at St. Mary Major)
The shortness of the winter days and the difficulty of going in procession to
the Vatican led to the substitution of St. Mary Major as the stational Church 
instead of St. Peter's. In the Middle Ages the Pope celebrated Mass in the great 
hall of Sicininus with unusual ceremony and great solemnity.
The Introit is from Isaiah: "Behold a child is born to us, and a son is given to 
us," Who, notwithstanding the infinite nothingness to which He stoops, is God 
eternal, the creator of the universe, Who rules and governs all things in the 
power of His Word, and upon Whose shoulder rests the divine and universal 
monarchy. He, as the brightness and express image of the Father, will reveal 
Him to men, and will be to them the envoy of the Most Holy Trinity, the angel or 
messenger of the glad tidings of redemption.
The Gospel, from St. John contains, perhaps, the most sublime page to be 
found in the whole of the Scriptures. It speaks of the twofold begetting of the 
Word in His divine and in His human nature. As the image of the supreme 
artificer, the Word is at once the prototype and the pattern of all that is created; 
but in Him this image is identical with His own substance, so that all things live 
in Him. The Word joins our human nature to His person, to make us sharers in 
the divine grace.
