In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was 
God. The same was in the beginning 
with God. All things were made by Him,
and without Him was made nothing that
was made: In Him was life, and the life 
was the light of men; and the light 
shineth in darkness, and the darkness 
did not comprehend it. There was a 
man sent from God, whose name was 
John. This man came for a witness, to 
testify concerning the light, that all 
might believe through Him. He was not 
the light, but he was to testify 
concerning the light. That was the true 
light, which enlighteneth every man that
cometh into this world. He was in the 
world, and the world was made by Him,
and the world knew Him not. He came 
unto His own, and His own received 
Him not. But as many as received Him, 
to them He gave power to become 
sons of God, to them that believe in His
Name, who are born not of blood, nor 
of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of 
man, but of God.
(Here all kneel)
AND THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH, 
and dwelt among us: and we saw His 
glory, the glory as of the Only begotten 
of the Father, full of grace and truth.
