Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the new birth in the flesh of 
Thine only-begotten Son may set us 
free, whom the old bondage doth hold 
under the yoke of sin. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
