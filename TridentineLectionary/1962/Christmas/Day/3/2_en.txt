God, Who at sundry times and in divers
manners spoke in times past to the 
fathers by the prophets, last of all in 
these days hath spoken to us by His 
Son, Whom He hath appointed heir of 
all things, by whom also He made the 
world: Who being the brightness of His 
glory and the figure of His substance, 
and upholding all things by the word of 
His power, making purgation of sins, 
sitteth on the right hand of the Majesty 
on high: being made so much better 
than the angels, as He hath inherited a 
more excellent name than they. For to 
which of the angels hath He said at any
time: Thou art my Son, today have I 
begotten Thee? And again: I will be to 
Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a 
Son? And again, when He bringeth in 
the first begotten into the world, He 
saith: And let all the angels of God 
adore Him. And to the angels indeed 
He saith: He that maketh His angels 
spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire.
But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is 
for ever and ever: a scepter of justice is
the scepter of Thy kingdom. Thou hast 
loved justice and hated iniquity: 
therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed 
Thee with the oil of gladness above 
Thy fellows. And: Thou in the 
beginning, O Lord, didst found the 
earth: and the works of Thy hands are 
the heavens. They shall perish, but 
Thou shalt continue: and they shall all 
grow old as a garment: and as a 
vesture shalt Thou change them and 
they shall be changed: but Thou art the
self-same, and Thy years shall not fail.
