Hail, holy Mother, thou who didst bring 
forth the King who rules heaven and 
earth for ever and ever. (Ps. 44: 2) My 
heart hath uttered a good word: I 
speak my works to the King. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Hail, holy 
Mother, thou who didst bring forth the 
King who rules heaven and earth for 
ever and ever.
