Dearly beloved: the goodness and
kindness of God our Savior appeared: 
not by the works of justice which we 
have done, but according to His mercy 
He saved us by the laver of 
regeneration and renovation of the Holy
Ghost, whom He hath poured forth 
upon us abundantly through Jesus 
Christ our Savior: that, being justified 
by His grace, we may be heirs 
according to hope of life everlasting: in 
Christ Jesus our Lord.
