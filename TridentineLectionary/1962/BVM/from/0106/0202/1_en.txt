O God, who by the fruitful virginity of
blessed Mary hast bestowed upon 
mankind the rewards of eternal 
salvation: grant, we beseech Thee, that
we may experience her intercession 
for us, through whom we have been 
made worthy to receive the Author of 
Life, Jesus Christ Thy Son, our Lord: 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
