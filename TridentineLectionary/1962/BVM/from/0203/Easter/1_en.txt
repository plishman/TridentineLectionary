Grant us Thy servants, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord God, to enjoy perpetual 
health of mind and body; and by the 
glorious intercession of blessed Mary 
ever Virgin, to be delivered from 
present sorrows and to enjoy 
everlasting gladness. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
