Strengthen in our minds, O Lord, we 
beseech Thee, the mysteries of the 
true faith: that confessing Him Who 
was conceived of the Virgin to be true 
God and true man, we may deserve, 
through the power of His saving 
resurrection, to attain everlasting joy. 
Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, our Lord, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
May these holy mysteries, O Lord, 
cleanse us by their powerful virtue and 
make us to come with greater purity to 
Him Who is their source. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
