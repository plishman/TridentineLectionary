Drop down dew, ye heavens, from 
above, and let the clouds rain the just: 
let the earth be opened and bud forth 
a Savior. (Ps. 84: 2) Lord, Thou hast 
blessed Thy land: Thou hast turned 
away the captivity of Jacob. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Drop down 
dew, ye heavens, from above, and let 
the clouds rain the just: let the earth be
opened and bud forth a Savior.
