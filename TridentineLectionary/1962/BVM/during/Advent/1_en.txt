O God, Who didst will that at the 
message of an Angel, Thy Word should
take flesh in the womb of the blessed 
Virgin Mary, grant that we, Thy 
suppliants, who believe her to be truly 
the Mother of God, may be helped by 
her intercession with Thee. Through 
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
Stir up Thy power, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord, and come: that from the 
threatening dangers of our sins we 
may deserve to be rescued by Thy 
protection, and to be saved by Thy 
deliverance. Who lives and reigns with 
God the Father in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
