Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
Thy grace into our hearts: that we, to 
whom the incarnation of Christ Thy Son
was made known by the message of 
an Angel, may, by His passion and 
cross, be brought to the glory of His 
Resurrection. Through the same Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
May we receive, O Lord, Thy mercy in 
the midst of Thy temple, that we may 
prepare with due honor for the 
approaching feast of our redemption. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
