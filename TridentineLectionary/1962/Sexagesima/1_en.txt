O God, who seest that we put not our 
trust in any thing that we do: mercifully 
grant that by the protection of the 
Doctor of the Gentiles we may be 
defended against all adversities. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
