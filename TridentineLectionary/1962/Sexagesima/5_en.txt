At that time, when a very great 
multitude was gathered together and 
hastened out of the cities unto Jesus, 
He spoke by a similitude: The sower 
went out to sow his seed: and as he 
sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it
was trodden down, and the fowls of the
air devoured it. And other some fell 
upon a rock: and as soon as it was 
sprung up, it withered away, because it 
had no moisture. And other some fell 
among thorns, and the thorns growing 
up with it choked it. And other some fell
upon good ground: and being sprung 
up yielded fruit a hundredfold. Saying 
these things, He cried out: He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear. And His 
disciples asked Him what this parable 
might be. To whom He said: To you it is
given to know the mystery of the 
kingdom of God, but to the rest in 
parables: that seeing they may not see,
and hearing may not understand. Now 
the parable is this. The seed is the 
word of God. And they by the wayside 
are they that hear: then the devil 
cometh and taketh the word out of their
heart, lest believing they should be 
saved. Now they upon the rock are 
they who, when they hear, receive the 
word with joy; and these have no roots:
for they believe for a while, and in time 
of temptation they fall away. And that 
which fell away among thorns are they 
who have heard and, going their way, 
are choked with the cares and riches 
and pleasures of this life, and yield no 
fruit. But on the good ground are they 
who in a good and perfect heart, 
hearing the word, keep it, and bring 
forth fruit in patience.
