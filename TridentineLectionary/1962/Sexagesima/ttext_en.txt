Today's Mass at the Basilica of St. Paul combines a melancholy strain of 
penitence with notes of rejoicing in honor of the Apostle of the Gentiles.
The Epistle describes vividly the incredible trial endured by St. Paul in his 
apostolate among the Gentiles.
The parable of the sower related in the Gospel, is aptly chosen by the 
Church for this feast of the Apostle Paul, who scattered the seed of the good 
tidings from Damascus and Arabia in the east even unto the Pillars of Hercules 
in the west.
Many are the evils that threaten our eternal salvation in the midst of the 
world; the good seed falls on the highway, but its growth is prevented in many 
ways. Each one of us should resolve at the foot of the altar to make use, as St. 
Paul would have us do, of every means to ensure our final salvation. What shall 
it profit us to gain the whole world, if by so doing we imperil our own soul?
