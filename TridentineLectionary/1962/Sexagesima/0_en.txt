Arise, why sleepest Thou, O Lord? 
arise, and cast us not off to the end. 
Why turnest Thou Thy face away, and 
forgettest our trouble? our belly hath 
cleaved to the earth: arise, O Lord, help
us and deliver us. (Ps. 43: 2) We have 
heard, O God, with our ears: our 
fathers have declared to us. Glory be to
the Father and to the Son and to the 
Holy Spirit as it was in the beginning, is
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Arise, why sleepest Thou, 
O Lord? arise, and cast us not off to the
end. Why turnest Thou Thy face away, 
and forgettest our trouble? Our belly 
hath cleaved to the earth: arise, O 
Lord, help us and deliver us.
