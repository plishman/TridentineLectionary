At that time, when Jesus was come 
down from the mountain, great 
multitudes followed Him: and behold a 
leper came and adored Him saying: 
Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me 
clean. And Jesus, stretching forth His 
hand touched him, saying: I will. Be 
thou made clean. And forthwith his 
leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus saith 
to him: See, thou tell no man: but go, 
show thyself to the priest, and offer
the gift which Moses commanded, for a
testimony unto them. And when He had
entered into Capharnaum, there came 
to Him a centurion, beseeching Him, 
and saying: Lord, my servant lieth at 
home sick of the palsy, and is 
grievously tormented. And Jesus saith 
to him: I will come and heal him. And 
the centurion making answer said: 
Lord, I am not worthy that Thou
should enter under my roof: but only 
say the word and my servant shall be 
healed. For I also am a man subject to 
authority, having under me soldiers; 
and I say to this: Go, and he goes; and 
to another: Come, and he comes; and 
to my servant: Do this, and he does it. 
And Jesus hearing this
marveled, and said to them that 
followed Him: Amen I say to you, I have
not found so great faith in IsraÃ«l. And I 
say to you, that many shall come from 
the east and the west, and shall sit 
down with Abraham and
Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of 
heaven: but the children of the 
kingdom shall be cast out into the 
exterior darkness: there shall be 
weeping and gnashing of teeth. And 
Jesus said to the centurion: Go, and as
thou hast believed, so be it done to 
thee. And the servant was healed at 
the same hour.
