Brethren: Be not wise in your own 
conceits. To no man rendering evil for 
evil: providing good things not only in 
the sight of God, but also in the sight of
all men. If it be possible, as much as is 
in you, have peace with all men. 
Revenge not yourselves, my dearly 
beloved, but give place unto wrath. For
it is written: Revenge is mine: I will 
repay, saith the Lord. But if thy enemy 
be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, 
give him to drink: for doing this, thou 
shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.
Be not overcome by evil, but 
overcome evil by good.
