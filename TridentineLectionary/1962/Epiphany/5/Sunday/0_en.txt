Adore God, all you His Angels: Sion
heard, and was glad: and the 
daughters of Juda rejoiced. (Ps. 96: 1) 
The Lord hath reigned, let the earth 
rejoice: let many islands be glad. Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Adore God, 
all you His Angels: Sion heard, and 
was glad: and the daughters of Juda 
rejoiced.
