May the operation of Thy power be in-
creased within us, we beseech Thee, O
Lord, that being quickened by Thy 
divine sacraments, we may by Thy 
bounty, be prepared to receive that 
which they promise. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
