The ordinary Sundays of the year are never characterized by any stational 
solemnity. This Sunday, counted either from Christmas or from the Epiphany in 
ancient Lectionaries, is an exception. Why this day was chosen for a station we 
do not know. Possibly on one of the days following the Epiphany there was a 
procession at St. Eusebius and when this procession was abandoned the 
station was transferred to the Sunday. 
The Communion tells of the miraculous changing of the water into wine and of 
the surprise of the ruler of the feast, and brings out fully the meaning of the 
miracle by connectfng it with the Holy Eucharist. Our Lord has kept the good 
wine until now because only in this last age of the world, the Messianic age, as 
St. John calls it, has He given to men the good wine of His Blood in the Blessed 
Sacrament. Furthermore, the sweetness of the holy love of God is an inebriating
draught which He keeps until the last for those Who serve Him faithlfully.
