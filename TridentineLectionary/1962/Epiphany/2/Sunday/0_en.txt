Let all the earth adore Thee, O God,
and sing to Thee: let it sing a psalm to 
Thy name, O Most High. (Ps. 65: 1-2) 
Shout with joy to God, all the earth, 
sing ye a psalm to His name: give glory
to His praise. Glory be to the Father 
and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now, and 
ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
Let all the earth adore Thee, O God, 
and sing to Thee: let it sing a psalm to 
Thy name, O Most High.
