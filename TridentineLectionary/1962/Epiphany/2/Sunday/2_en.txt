Brethren: Having different gifts, 
according to the grace that is given us: 
either prophecy, to be used according 
to the rule of faith; or ministry, in 
ministering; or he that teaches, in 
doctrine; he that exhorts, in exhorting; 
he that gives, with simplicity; he that 
rules, with carefulness; he that shows 
mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be 
without dissimulation. Hating that which
is evil, cleaving to that which is good: 
loving one another with the charity of 
brotherhood, with honor preventing one
another: in carefulness not slothful: in 
spirit fervent: serving the Lord: rejoicing
in hope: patient in tribulation: instant in 
prayer: communicating to the 
necessities of the saints: pursuing 
hospitality. Bless them that persecute 
you: bless, and curse not. Rejoice with 
them that rejoice, weep with them that 
weep: being of one mind one towards 
another; not minding high things, but 
consenting to the humble.
