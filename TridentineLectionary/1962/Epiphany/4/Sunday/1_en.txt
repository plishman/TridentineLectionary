O God, Who knowest us to be set in 
the midst of dangers so great that, by 
reason of the frailty of our nature, we 
cannot always withstand; grant to us 
health of mind and body, that being 
helped by Thee, we may overcome the 
things which we suffer for our sins. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
