At that time Jesus spoke to the 
multitudes this parable: The kingdom of
heaven is like to a grain of mustard 
seed, which a man took and sowed in 
his field: which is the least indeed of all 
seeds: but when it is grown up, it is 
greater than all herbs and becomes a 
tree, so that the birds of the air come 
and dwell in the branches thereof.
Another parable He spoke to them: The
kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, 
which a woman took and hid in three 
measures of meal, until the whole was 
leavened. All these things Jesus spoke 
in parables to the
multitudes: and without parables He 
did not speak to them: that it might be 
fulfilled which was spoken by the 
Prophet, saying: I will open my mouth 
in parables, I will utter things hidden 
from the foundation of the world.
