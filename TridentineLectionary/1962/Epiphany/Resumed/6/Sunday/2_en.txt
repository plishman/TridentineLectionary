Brethren: We give thanks to God 
always for you all, making a 
remembrance of you in our prayers 
without ceasing, being mindful of the 
work of your faith and labor and charity,
and of the enduring of the hope of our 
Lord Jesus Christ before
God and our Father: knowing, 
brethren beloved of God, your election:
for our Gospel hath not been unto you 
in word only, but in power also, and in 
the Holy Spirit, and in much fullness, as
you know what manner of men we 
have been among
you for your sakes. And you became
followers of us and of the Lord, 
receiving the word in much tribulation, 
with joy of the Holy Spirit: so that you 
were made a pattern to all that believe 
in Macedonia and in Achaia. For from 
you was spread abroad the word of the
Lord, not only in Macedonia and in 
Achaia, but also in every place your 
faith, which is towards God, is gone 
forth, so that we need not to speak
any thing. For they themselves relate of
us what manner of entering in we had 
unto you; and how you turned to God 
from idols to serve the living and true 
God, and to wait for His Son from 
heaven (whom He raised up from the 
dead), Jesus, who hath delivered us 
from the wrath to come.
