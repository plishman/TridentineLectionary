At that time, when Jesus entered into 
the boat, His disciples followed Him: 
and behold a great tempest arose in 
the sea, so that the boat was covered 
with waves, but He was asleep. And 
His disciples came to Him and awoke 
Him, saying: Lord, save us, we perish. 
And Jesus saith to them: Why are you 
fearful, O ye of little faith? Then rising 
up, He commanded the winds and the 
sea, and there came a great calm. But
the men wondered, saying: What 
manner of man is this, for the winds 
and the sea obey him?
