The Lord saith: I think thoughts of 
peace, and not of affliction: you shall 
call upon Me, and I will hear you; and I
will bring back your captivity from all 
places. (Ps. 84: 2) Lord, Thou hast 
blessed Thy land: Thou hast turned 
away the captivity of Jacob. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is not, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. The Lord 
saith: I think thoughts of peace, and not
of affliction: you shall call upon Me, and
I will hear you; and I will bring back 
your captivity from all places.
