Thou hast delivered us, O Lord, from 
them that afflict us: and hast put them 
to shame that hate us. In God we will 
glory all the day: and in Thy name we 
will give praise forever. (Ps. 129.1-2) 
Alleluia, alleluia. Out of the depths I 
have cried to Thee, O Lord: Lord, hear 
my prayer. Alleluia.
