Brethren: Owe no man any thing, but to
love one another: for he that loveth his 
neighbor hath fulfilled the law. For Thou
shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt 
not kill: Thou shalt not steal: Thou 
shalt not bear false witness: Thou 
shalt not covet: and if there be any 
other commandment, it is comprised in 
this word: Thou shalt love thy neighbor 
as thyself. The love of our neighbor 
worketh no evil. Love therefore is the 
fulfilling of the law.
