At that time Jesus spoke this parable to
the multitudes: The kingdom of heaven 
is likened to a man that sowed good 
seed in his field. But while men were 
asleep, his enemy came and 
oversowed cockle among the wheat, 
and went his way. And when the blade 
was sprung up and had brought forth
fruit, then appeared also the cockle. 
And the servants of the good man of 
the house coming, said to him: Sir, 
didst thou not sow good seed in thy 
field? Whence then hath it cockle? And
he said to them: An enemy hath done 
this. And the servants said to him: Wilt 
thou that we go and gather it up? And 
he said: No, lest perhaps, gathering up 
the cockle, you root up the wheat also 
together with it. Suffer both to grow 
until the harvest, and in the time of the 
harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather
up first the cockle and bind it into 
bundles to burn, but the wheat gather 
ye into my barn.
