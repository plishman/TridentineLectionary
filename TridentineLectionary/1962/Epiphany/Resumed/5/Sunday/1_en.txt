In Thine infinite goodness, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, to watch over 
Thy household, that even as it relies 
solely upon the hope of Thy heavenly 
grace, so it may ever be defended by 
Thy protection. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
