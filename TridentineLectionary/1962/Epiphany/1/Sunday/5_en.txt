When Jesus was twelve years old, they
went up to Jerusalem according to the 
custom of the feast. And after they had 
fulfilled the days, when they were 
returning, the Boy Jesus remained in 
Jerusalem, and His parents did not 
know it. But thinking that He was in the 
caravan, they had come a day’s 
journey before it occurred to them to 
look for Him among their relatives and 
acquaintances. And not finding Him, 
they returned to Jerusalem in search of
Him. And it came to pass after three 
days, that they found Him in the 
temple, sitting in the midst of the 
teachers, listening to them and asking 
them questions. And all who were 
listening to Him were amazed at His 
understanding and His answers. And 
when they saw Him, they were 
astonished. And His Mother said to 
Him, Son, why hast Thou done so to 
us? Behold, in sorrow Thy father and I 
have been seeking Thee. And He said 
to them, How is it that you sought Me? 
Did you not know that I must be about 
My Father’s business? And they did not
understand the word that He spoke to 
them. And He went down with them 
and came to Nazareth, and was subject
to them; and His Mother kept all these 
things carefully in her heart. And Jesus 
advanced in wisdom and age and 
grace before God and men.
