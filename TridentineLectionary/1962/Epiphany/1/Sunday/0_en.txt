Upon a high throne I saw a man sitting,
Whom a multitude of angels adore, 
singing in unison: Behold Him, the 
name of Whose empire is forever.
Ps 99:1 Sing joyfully to God, all you 
lands; serve the Lord with gladness. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Upon a high
throne I saw a man sitting, Whom a 
multitude of angels adore, singing in 
unison: Behold Him, the name of 
Whose empire is forever.
