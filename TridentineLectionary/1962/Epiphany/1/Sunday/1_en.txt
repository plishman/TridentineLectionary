O Lord, we beseech Thee, in Thy 
heavenly goodness, hear Thy suppliant
people; that they may both perceive 
what they ought to do, and have the 
strength to fulfill what they have seen. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
