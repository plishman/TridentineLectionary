O Almighty God, grant, we humbly 
beseech Thee, that those whom Thou 
dost refresh with Thy sacrament may 
also worthily serve Thee in a way that 
is well pleasing to Thee. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
