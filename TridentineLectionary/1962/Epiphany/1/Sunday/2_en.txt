Brethren: I exhort you, by the mercy of 
God, to present your bodies as a 
sacrifice, living, holy, pleasing to God - 
your reasonable service. And be not 
conformed to this world, but be 
transformed in the newness of your 
mind, that you may discern what is the 
good and acceptable and perfect will of
God. By the grace that has been given 
to me, I say to each one among you: let
no one rate himself more than he 
ought, but let him rate himself 
according to moderation, and according
as God has apportioned to each one 
the measure of faith. For just as in one 
body we have many members, yet all 
the members have not the same 
function, so we, the many, are one 
body in Christ, but severally members, 
one of another, in Christ Jesus, our 
Lord.
