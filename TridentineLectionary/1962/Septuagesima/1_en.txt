Graciously hear, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, the prayers of Thy people, that 
we who are justly afflicted for our sins, 
may be mercifully delivered by Thy 
goodness, for the glory of Thy name. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
