Out of the depths I have cried to Thee, 
O Lord: Lord, hear my voice. Let Thine
ears be attentive to the prayer of Thy 
servant. If Thou, O Lord, wilt mark 
iniquities: O Lord, who shall abide it? 
For with Thee there is merciful 
forgiveness, and by reason of Thy law I
have waited for Thee, O Lord.
