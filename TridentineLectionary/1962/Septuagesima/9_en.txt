May Thy faithful people, O Lord, be
strengthened by Thy gifts: that by 
partaking of them, they may continue to
seek after them, and by seeking them, 
they may partake of them without end. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
