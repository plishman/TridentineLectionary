Station at St. Lawrence-without-the-Walls. 
The Eastern usage regarded Saturday and Sunday as festival days, and
therefore as exempt from the Lenten fast; so, in order to complete the forty days
of Lent, the Greeks anticipated the penitential season by some weeks, and from
this Sunday onward abstained from the use of meat. Among the Latins four days
had to be supplied making Lent begin on Ash Wednesday; the piety of the more 
devout wished for something more. St. Gregory therefore instituted, or at least 
gave definite form to, a cycle of three weeks' preparation for Lent, with three 
solemn stations at the patriarchal Basilicas of St. Lawrence, St. Paul, and St. 
Peter, as though to begin the Easter fast under the auspices of the three great 
patrons of the Eternal City.
From this Sunday until Maundy Thursday the Gloria in excelsis is omitted in 
Masses of the season. The Collect, which immediately follows the litany (at 
present the Kyrie) on days of fasting and penance, truly represents, therefore,
the ordinary and normal form of the litany as used in the ancient liturgy of the 
Mass and of the Divine Office.
The fruit of today's meditation on the Epistle of St. Paul and on the parable 
of the vineyard is the uncertainty of eternal salvation. It is not enough for us to 
have been baptized or called to a holy state; it is necessary to labor diligently 
and imitate the chosen few, that is, the saints and martyrs.
