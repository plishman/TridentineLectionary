At that time Jesus spoke to his 
disciples this parable: The kingdom of 
heaven is like to an householder who 
went out early in the morning to hire 
laborers into his vineyard. And having 
agreed with the laborers for a penny a 
day, he sent them into his vineyard. 
And going out about the third hour, he 
saw others standing in the market 
place idle, and he said to them: Go you
also into my vineyard, and I will give 
you what shall be just. And they went 
their way. And again he went out about 
the sixth and the ninth hour: and did in 
like manner. But about the eleventh 
hour he went out and found others 
standing, and he said to them: Why 
stand you here all the day idle? They 
say to him: Because no man has hired 
us. He said to them: Go you also into 
my vineyard. And when evening was 
come, the lord of the vineyard said to 
his steward: Call the laborers and pay 
them their hire, beginning from the last 
even to the first. When therefore they 
were come that came about the 
eleventh hour, they received every man
a penny. But when the first also came, 
they thought that they should receive 
more: and they also received every 
man a penny. And receiving it they 
murmured against the master of the 
house, saying: These last have worked 
but one hour, and thou hast made them
equal to us that have borne the burden 
of the day and the heats. But he 
answering said to one of them: Friend, I
do thee no wrong: did thou not agree 
with me for a penny? Take what is thine
and go thy way: I will also give to this 
last even as to thee. Or, is it not lawful 
for me to do what I will? Is thy eye evil, 
because I am good? So shall the last 
be first, and the first last. For many are 
called, but few chosen.
