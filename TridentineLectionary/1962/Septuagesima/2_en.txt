Brethren: Know you not that they that 
run in the race, all run indeed, but one 
receiveth the prize? So run that you 
may obtain. And everyone that striveth 
for the mastery refraineth himself from 
all things: and they indeed that they 
may receive a corruptible crown; but 
we an incorruptible one. I therefore so 
run, not as at an uncertainty; I so fight, 
not as one beating the air; but I 
chastise my body, and bring it into 
subjection, lest perhaps when I have 
preached to others, I myself should 
become a castaway. For I would not 
have you ignorant, brethren, that our 
fathers were all under the cloud, and all
passed through the sea, and all in 
Moses were baptized, in the cloud and 
in the sea: and did all eat the same 
spiritual food, and all drank the same 
spiritual drink: (and they drank of the 
spiritual rock that followed them: and 
the rock was Christ). But with most of 
them God was not well pleased.
