The sorrows of death surrounded me, 
the sorrow of hell encompassed me: 
and in my affliction I called upon the 
Lord, and He heard my voice from His 
holy Temple. (Ps. 17: 2-3) I will love 
Thee, O Lord, my strength: the Lord is 
my firmament, my refuge, and my 
deliverer. Glory be to the Father, and 
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. The
sorrows of death surrounded me, the 
sorrow of hell encompassed me: and in
my affliction I called upon the Lord, and
He heard my voice from His holy 
Temple.
