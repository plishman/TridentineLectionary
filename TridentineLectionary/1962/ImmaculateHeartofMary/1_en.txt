Almighty everlasting God, who in the 
heart of the blessed Virgin Mary didst 
prepare a dwelling worthy of the Holy 
Spirit; grant in Thy mercy, that we who 
with devout minds celebrate the festival
of that immaculate heart, may be able 
to live according to Thine own Heart. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
