We who offer to Thy majesty the Lamb
without blemish, beseech Thee, O 
Lord, that our hearts may be kindled by
that divine fire which so ineffably 
inflamed the heart of the blessed Virgin
Mary. Through the same Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
