Refreshed by these divine gifts we 
humbly beseech Thee, O Lord, that by 
the intercession of the Blessed Virgin 
Mary whose immaculate heart we now 
solemnly celebrate, we may be 
delivered from present dangers and 
obtain the joys of eternal life. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
