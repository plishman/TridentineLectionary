Be Thou unto me a God, a Protector, 
and a place of refuge, to save me; for 
Thou art my strength and my refuge: 
and for Thy Name's sake Thou wilt lead
me, and nourish me. (Ps. 30: 2) In 
Thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me 
never be confounded: deliver me in Thy
justice, and save me. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Be Thou unto me a God, 
a Protector, and a place of refuge, to 
save me; for Thou art my strength and 
my refuge: and for Thy Name's sake 
Thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.
