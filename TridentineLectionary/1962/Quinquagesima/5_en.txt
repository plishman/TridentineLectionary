At that time Jesus took unto Him the 
twelve and said to them: Behold, we 
go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall 
be accomplished which were written by
the Prophets concerning the Son of 
Man. For He shall be delivered to the 
Gentiles, and shall be mocked and 
scourged and spit upon: and after they 
have scourged Him, they will put Him to
death, and the third day He shall rise 
again. And they understood none of 
these things, and the word was hid 
from them, and they understood not the
things that were said. Now it came to 
pass, when He drew nigh to Jericho, 
that a certain blind man sat by the 
wayside begging. And when he heard 
the multitude passing by, he asked 
what this meant. And they told him that 
Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. And
he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of 
David, have mercy on me. And they 
that went before rebuked him, that he 
should hold his peace. But he cried out
much more: Son of David, have mercy 
on me. And Jesus standing, 
commanded him to brought unto him. 
And when he was come near, He 
asked him, saying: What wilt thou that 
I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I 
may see. And Jesus said to him: 
Receive thy sight, thy faith hath made 
thee whole. And immediately he saw 
and followed Him, glorifying God. And 
all the people, when they saw it, gave 
praise to God.
