Station at St. Peter. 
Having assured ourselves by the stations at St. Lawrence and St. Paul on
the two preceding Sundays of the patronage of these saints we go today to the 
Basilica of St. Peter and on next Sunday to that of the Holy Savior in order to 
commence with full confidence the holy cycle of penance. On Wednesday of this
week the Church begins the Lenten fast.
In the Epistle, St. Paul attempts to raise a corner of the veil which hides the 
Eternal Love from the eyes of mortals. God is the primary and immediate object
of the precept of charity, as He is the final end to which the creature tends. 
Nevertheless, the Apostle dwells rather upon His illuminative intercourse with 
men, in so far as they are created in His likeness and are the mystical members 
of Christ.
The Gospel gives us the definite announcement of the approaching Passion
of Our Lord. The miracle of the blind man confirms the wavering faith of the 
disciples. Even the Apostles did not yet understand the mystery of the cross; 
how necessary, then, is it for us to meditate upon Christ crucified, lest we should
fail in a matter of the highest moment, towards which the whole of our spiritual 
life should be directed - that is, the mystery of expiation through suffering.
