At that time: when it was late, that 
same day, the first of the week, and the
doors were shut, where the disciples 
were gathered together for fear of the 
Jews, Jesus came and stood in the 
midst, and said to them: Peace be to 
you. And when he had said this, He 
showed them His hands and His side. 
The disciples therefore were glad, 
when they saw the Lord. He said 
therefore to them again: Peace be to 
you. As the Father hath sent Me, I 
also send you. When He had said this,
He breathed on them; and said to 
them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost. 
Whose sins you shall forgive, they are 
forgiven them; and whose sins you 
shall retain, they are retained.
