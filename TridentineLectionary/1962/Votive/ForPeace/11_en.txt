O God, the Author and Lover of peace, 
Whom to know is to live, and to serve is
to reign; protect Thy suppliants from all 
assaults, that we who trust in Thy 
defense, may fear
no armed hostility. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
