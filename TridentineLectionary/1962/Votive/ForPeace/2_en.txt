To the brethren, the Jews that are 
throughout Egypt, the brethren, the 
Jews that are in Jerusalem, and in the 
land of Judea, send health, and good 
peace. May God be gracious to you, 
and remember His covenant that He 
made with Abraham, and Isaac, and 
Jacob, His faithful servants: And give 
you all a heart to worship Him and to 
do His wllI with a great heart, and a 
willing mind. May He open your heart 
in His law, and in His commandments, 
and send you peace. May He near 
your prayers, and be reconciled unto 
you, and never forsake you in the evil 
time.
