O God, Who sufferest not the nations 
that believe in Thee to be shaken by 
any fear, deign, we beseech Thee, to 
receive the prayers and sacrifices of 
the people consecrated to Thee, that 
peace, the gift of Thy loving-kindness, 
may render Christian countries safe
from every enemy. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
