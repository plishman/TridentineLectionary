O God, from Whom are holy desires, 
right counsels, and just works, give to 
Thy servants that peace which the 
world cannot give; that our hearts being
devoted to the keeping of Thy 
commandments, and the fear of 
enemies removed, our times, by Thy
protection, may be peaceful. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
