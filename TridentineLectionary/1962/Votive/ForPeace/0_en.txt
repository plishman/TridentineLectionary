Give peace, O Lord, to them that 
patiently wait for Thee, that Thy 
prophets may be found faithful: hear 
the prayers of Thy servant, and of
Thy people Israel. (P. T. Aileluia, 
alleluia.) (Ps. 121: 1) I rejoiced at the 
things that were said to me: We shall 
go into the house of the Lord. Glory be
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Give peace,
O Lord, to them that patiently wait for 
Thee, that Thy prophets may be found 
faithful: hear the prayers of Thy 
servant, and of Thy people Israel.
