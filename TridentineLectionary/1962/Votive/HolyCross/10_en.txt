It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation, that we should at all 
times and in all places, give thanks 
unto Thee, O holy Lord, Father 
almighty, everlasting God Who didst 
establish the salvation of mankind on 
the tree of the Cross that whence death
came, thence also life might rise again, 
and that he, who overcame by the tree,
by the tree also might be overcome: 
Through Christ our Lord. Through 
whom the Angels praise Thy majesty, 
the DÃ³minations worship it, the Powers 
stand in awe. The heavens and the 
heavenly hosts together with the 
blessed Seraphim in triumphant chorus
unite to celebrate it. Together with 
these we entreat Thee, that Thou 
mayest bid our voices also to be 
admitted while we say with lowly 
praise:
