Brethren: Christ became for us 
obedient unto death, even to the death
of the cross. For which cause God also 
hath exalted Him, and hath given Him a
Name which is above all names:
(here all kneel)
that in the Name of Jesus every knee 
should bow, of those that are in 
Heaven, on earth, and under the earth 
and that every tongue should confess 
that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory
of God the Father.
(During Eastertide the Gradual, Lesser 
Alleluia, and Tract are omitted and the 
Greater Alleluia is said instead)
