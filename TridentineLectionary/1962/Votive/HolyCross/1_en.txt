O God, Who wast pleased to sanctify 
the standard of the life-giving cross with
the blood of Thine only-begottten Son, 
Grant, we beseech Thee, that those 
who rejoice in honoring the same holy 
cross may also everywhere rejoice in 
Thy protection. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
O God, Who didst will that for our 
sakes Thy Son should undergo the 
torment of the cross, to free us from 
the power of the enemy, grant us, Thy 
servants, that we may attain unto the 
glory of the resurrection. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
