We adore Thee, O Christ, and we 
bless Thee, because by Thy cross 
Thou didst redeem the world. V. We 
adore Thy cross, O Lord, we 
commemorate Thy glorious passion; 
have mercy on us, Thou Who didst 
suffer for us. V. O blessed cross, that
alone wastÂ· worthy to bear the Lord 
and king of the heavens.
