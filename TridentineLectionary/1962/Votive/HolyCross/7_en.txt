At that time: Jesus took the twelve 
disciples apart, and said to them: 
Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the
Son of man shall be betrayed to the 
chief priests and the scribes, and they 
shall condemn Him to death. And shall 
deliver Him to the gentiles to be 
mocked, and scourged, and crucified, 
and the third day He shall rise again.
