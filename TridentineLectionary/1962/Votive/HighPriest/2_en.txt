Bretheren: Every high priest taken from
among men, is ordained for men in the 
things that appertain to God, that he 
may offer up gifts and sacrifices for 
sins; who can have compassion on 
them that are ignorant and err: 
because he himself also is compassed 
with infirmity. And therefore he ought, 
as for the people, so also for himself, to
offer for sins. Neither doth any man 
take the honour to himself, but he that 
is called by God, as Aaron was. So 
Christ also did not glorify himself, that 
He might be made a high priest: but He
that said unto Him: Thou art my Son, 
this day have I begotten Thee. As He 
saith also in another place: Thou art a 
priest for ever, accordingto the order of 
Melchisedech. Who in the days of his 
flesh, with a strong cry and tears, 
offering up prayers and supplications to
Him that was able to save Him from 
death, was heard for His reverence. 
And whereas indeed He was the Son 
of God, He learned obedience by the 
things which He suffered: and being 
consummated, He became, to all that 
obey Him, the cause of eternal 
salvation. Called by God a high priest 
according to the order of 
Melchisedech. Of whom we have to 
say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered.
