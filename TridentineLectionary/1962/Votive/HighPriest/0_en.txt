The Lord hath sworn, and He will not 
repent: Thou art a priest for ever 
according to the order of 
Melchisedech. (P.T. Alleluia, alleluia.) 
(Ps. 109: 1) The Lord said to my Lord: 
Sit thou at my right hand. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. The Lord hath sworn, and
He will not repent: Thou art a priest for 
ever according to the order of 
Melchisedech. (P.T. Alleluia, alleluia.)
