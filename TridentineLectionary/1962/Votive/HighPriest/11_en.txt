We beseech Thee, O Lord, may the 
divine host which we have offered up 
and received, quicken us; that, bound 
to Thee by an eternal love, we may 
bear fruit that will abide forever. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
