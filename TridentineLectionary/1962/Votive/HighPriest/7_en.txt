At that time: Jesus sat down, and the 
twelve Apostles with Him. And He said 
to them: With desire I have desired to 
eat this pasch with you, before I suffer. 
For I say to you, that from this time I 
will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the 
kingdom of God. And having taken the 
chalice, He gave thanks, and said: 
Take, and divide it among you: for I say
to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of 
the vine, till the kingdom of God come. 
And taking bread, He gave thanks, and
brake; and gave to them, saying: This 
is my Body, which is given for you. Do 
this for commemmoration of me. In like 
manner the chalice also, after he had 
supped saying: This is the chalice, the 
new testament in my Blood, which shall
be shed for you.
