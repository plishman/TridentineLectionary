O God, who for the glory of Thy 
Majesty and the salvation of the human
race, didst establish Thine only 
begotten Son as the supreme and 
eternal Priest: grant that those He has 
chosen to dispense His mysteries may 
prove loyal in carrying out the ministry 
they have received. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
