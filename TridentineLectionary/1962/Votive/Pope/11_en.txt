We beseech Thee, O Lord, may the 
partaking of this divine Sacrament 
protect us, and ever save and defend 
Thy servant N., whom Thou hast been 
pleased to appoint as pastor over Thy 
Church, together with the flock 
committed to his care. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
