Favorably accept, we beseech Thee, O
Lord, the gifts we offer, and by Thy 
continual protection govern Thy 
servant, N., whom Thou hast been 
pleased to appoint as pastor over Thy 
Church. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
