O God, Shepherd and Ruler of all the 
faithful, look propitiously upon Thy 
servant N., whom Thou hast been
pleased to appoint pastor over Thy 
Church, grant, we beseech Thee, that 
both by word and by example he may
edify those over whom he is placed, 
and, together with the flock committed 
to his care, may attain unto life 
everlasting. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
