At that time, Jesus came into the 
quarters of CÃ¦sarea Philippi, and He 
asked His disciples, Saying, Whom do 
men say that the Son of man is? But 
they said, Some, John the Baptist, and 
other some, Elias, and others, 
Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 
Jesus saith to them, But whom do you 
say that I am? Simon Peter answered,
Thou art Christ, the Son of the living 
God. And Jesus answering, said to 
him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona,
because flesh and blood hath not 
revealed it to thee, but My Father Who 
is in Heaven: and I say to thee, that 
thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build My Church, and the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against it; and to thee I
will give the keys of the kingdom of 
Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt 
bind upon earth, it shall be bound also 
in Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt 
loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in
Heaven.
