Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the
strangers dispersed through Pontus, 
Galat√≠a, Cappadocia, Asia, and 
Bithynia, elect according to the fore-
knowledge of God the Father, unto the 
sanctification of the Spirit, unto 
obedience, and sprinkling of the blood 
of Jesus Christ; grace unto you
and peace be multiplied. Blessed be 
the God and Father of Our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Who according to His great 
mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively
hope, by the resurrection of Jesus 
Christ from the dead, unto an 
inheritance incorruptible and undefiled,
and that can not fade, reserved in 
heaven for you, who by the power of 
God are kept by faith unto salvation, 
ready to be revealed in the last time 
Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if 
now you must be for a little time made 
sorrowful in divers temptations: that 
the trial of your faith, much more 
precious than gold (which is tried by the
fire), may be found unto praise, and 
glory, and honour, at the appearing of 
Jesus Christ our Lord.
