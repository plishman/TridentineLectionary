Have mercy upon us, O God of all, and
behold us, and show us the light of 
Thy mercies: and send Thy fear upon 
the nations that have not sought after 
Thee: that they may know that there is 
no God besides Thee, and that they 
may show forth Thy wonders. Lift up 
Thy hand over the strange nations, 
that they may see Thy power. For as 
Thou hast been sanctified in us in their
sight, so Thou shalt be magnified 
among them in our presence. That 
they may know Thee, as we also have 
known Thee, that there is no God 
besides Thee, O Lord. Renew Thy 
signs, and work new miracles. Glorify 
Thy hand, and Thy right arm. Raise up
indignation, and pour out wrath. Take 
away the adversary, and crush the 
enemy. Hasten the time, and 
remember the end, that they may 
declare Thy wonderful works. Give 
testimony to them that are Thy 
creatures from the beginning, and 
raise up the prophecies which the 
former prophets spoke in Thy name. 
Reward them that patiently wait for 
Thee, that Thy prophets may be found 
faithful: and hear the prayers of Thy 
servants, according to the blessing of 
Aaron over Thy people, and direct us 
into the way of justice, and let all know 
that dwell upon earth that Thou art 
God, the beholder of all ages.
