At that time, Jesus went about all the 
cities and towns, teaching in their 
synagogues, and preaching the gospel 
of the kingdom, and healing every 
disease, and every infirmity. And 
seeing the multitudes, He had 
compassion on them: because they 
were distressed, and lying like sheep 
that have no shepherd. Then He saith 
to His disciples: the harvest indeed is 
great, but the laborers are few. Pray ye
therefore the Lord of the harvest, that 
He send forth laborers into His harvest.
