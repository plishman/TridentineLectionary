O God, Who willest that all men should
be saved and should come to the 
knowledge of the truth: we beseech 
Thee, send forth laborers into Thy 
harvest, and grant them grace to speak
Thy word with all boldness, so that Thy
word may run and be glorified, and all 
nations may know Thee, the only God 
and Him Whom Thou hast sent: even 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
