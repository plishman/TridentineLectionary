May God have mercy upon us, and 
bless us: may He cause the light of His
countenance to shine upon us, and 
may He have mercy upon us: that we 
may know Thy way upon earth, Thy 
salvation in all nations. (Psalm 66: 4) 
Let the people confess to Thee, O 
God: let all people give praise to Thee. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. May God 
have mercy upon us, and bless us: 
may He cause the light of His 
countenance to shine upon us, and 
may He have mercy upon us: that we 
may know Thy way upon earth, Thy 
salvation in all nations.
