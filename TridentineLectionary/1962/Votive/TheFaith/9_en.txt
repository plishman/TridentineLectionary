Behold, O God, our Protector, and look 
upon the Face of Thine Anointed, who 
gave Himself a redemption for us all, 
and grant that from the rising of the 
sun even to its going down, Thy Name 
may be great among the Gentiles, and 
that in every place there may be 
sacrifice and a pure oblation offered to 
Thy Name. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
