Brethren, Rejoice in the Lord always: 
again I say, rejoice. Let your modesty 
be known to all men: The Lord is nigh. 
Be nothing solicitous: but in everything,
by prayer and supplication, with 
thanksgiving, let your petitions be 
made known to God. And the peace of 
God, which surpasses all 
understanding, keep your hearts and 
minds in Christ Jesus our Lord.
