Rejoice in the Lord always: again I say,
rejoice. Let your modesty be known to 
all men: for the Lord is nigh. Be nothing
solicitous: but in everything by prayer 
let your petitions be made known to 
God. (Ps. 84: 2) Lord, Thou hast 
blessed Thy land: Thou hast turned 
away the captivity of Jacob. Glory be 
to the Father and to the Son and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. Rejoice in the Lord always:
again I say, rejoice. Let your modesty 
be known to all men: for the Lord is 
nigh. Be nothing solicitous: but in 
everything by prayer let your petitions 
be made known to God.
