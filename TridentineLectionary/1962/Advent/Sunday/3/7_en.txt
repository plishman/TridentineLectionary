May the sacrifice of our devotion, we
beseech Thee, O Lord, be always 
offered unto Thee: that it may both 
fulfill the end for which Thou didst 
institute this sacred mystery, and 
wonderfully work in us Thy salvation. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, who lives and reigns in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
