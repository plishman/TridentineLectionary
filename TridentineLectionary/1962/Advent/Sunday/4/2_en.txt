Brethren, Let a man so account of us 
as of the ministers of Christ and the 
dispensers of the mysteries of God. 
Here now it is required among the 
dispensers that a man be found 
faithful. But to me it is a very small 
thing to be judged by you or by man's 
day: but neither do I judge my own self.
For I am not conscious to myself of 
anything: yet am I not hereby justified, 
by He that judges me is the Lord. 
Therefore judge not before the time, 
until the Lord come: Who both will 
bring to light the hidden things of 
darkness, and will make manifest the 
counsels fo the hearts: and then shall 
every man have praise from God.
