Drop down dew, ye heavens, from 
above, and let the clouds rain the Just: 
let the earth be opened and bud forth a
Savior. (Ps. 18: 2) The heavens show 
forth the glory of God: and the 
firmament declares the work of His 
hands. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Drop down dew, ye heavens, from 
above, and let the clouds rain the Just: 
let the earth be opened and bud forth a
Savior.
