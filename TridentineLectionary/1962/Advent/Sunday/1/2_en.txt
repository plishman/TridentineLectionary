Brethren, knowing that it is now the 
hour for us to rise from sleep. For now 
our salvation is nearer than when we 
believed. The night is past and the day 
is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the 
works of darkness, and put on the 
armor of light. Let us walk honestly, as 
in the day: not in rioting and 
drunkenness, not in chambering and 
impurities, not in contention and envy: 
but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.
