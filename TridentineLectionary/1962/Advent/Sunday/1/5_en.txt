At that time Jesus said to His disciples:
There shall be signs in the sun, and in 
the moon, and in the stars; and upon 
the earth distress of nations, by reason
of the confusion of the roaring of the 
sea and of the waves: men withering 
away for fear and expectations of what 
shall come upon the whole world. For 
the powers of heaven shall be moved. 
And then they shall see the Son of Man
coming in a cloud with great power and
majesty. But when these things begin 
to come to pass, look up and lift up 
your heads, because your redemption 
is at hand. And He spoke to them a 
similitude: See the fig tree and all the 
trees: when they now shoot forth their 
fruit, you know that summer is nigh. So
you also, when you shall see these 
things come to pass, know that the 
kingdom of God is at hand. Amen, I say
to you, this generation shall not pass 
away till all things be fulfilled. Heaven 
and earth shall pass away: but My 
words shall not pass away.
