To Thee have I lifted up my soul: in 
Thee, O my God, I put my trust, let me 
not be ashamed: neither let my 
enemies laugh at me: for none of them 
that wait on Thee shall be confounded. 
(Ps.24: 4) Show, O Lord, Thy ways to 
me: and teach me Thy paths. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. To Thee 
have I lifted up my soul: in Thee, O my 
God, I put my trust, let me not be 
ashamed: neither let my enemies laugh
at me: for none of them that wait on 
Thee shall be confounded.
