People of Sion, behold the Lord shall 
come to save the nations: and the Lord
shall make the glory of His voice to be 
heard, in the joy of your heart. (Ps. 79:
2) Give ear, O Thou that rules Israel: 
Thou that leads Joseph like a sheep. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. People of 
Sion, behold the Lord shall come to 
save the nations: and the Lord shall 
make the glory of His voice to be 
heard, in the joy of your heart.
