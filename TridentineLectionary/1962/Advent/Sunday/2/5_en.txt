At that time, when John had heard in 
prison the works of Christ, sending two 
of his disciples, he said to Him: Art thou
He that art to come, or look we for 
another? And Jesus, making answer, 
said to them: Go and relate to John 
what you have heard and seen. The 
blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are
cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise 
again, the poor have the gospel 
preached to them: and blessed is he 
that shall not be scandalized in Me. 
And when they went their way, Jesus 
began to say to the multitudes 
concerning John: What went you out 
into the desert to see? A reed shaken 
with the wind? But what went you out 
to see? A man clothed in soft 
garments? Behold they that are clothed
in soft garments are in the houses of 
kings. But what went you out to see? A 
prophet? Yea I tell you, and more than 
a prophet. For this is he of whom it is 
written: Behold, I send my Angel before
Thy face, who shall prepare Thy way 
before Thee.
