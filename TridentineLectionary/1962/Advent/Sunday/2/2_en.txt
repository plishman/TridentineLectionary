Brethren, What things soever were 
written, were written for our learning: 
that, through patience and the comfort 
of the Scriptures, we might have hope. 
Now the God of patience and of 
comfort grant you to be of one mind 
according to Jesus Christ, that with one
mind and one mouth you may glorify 
the God and Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ. Wherefore receive one another, 
as Christ also hath received you unto 
the honor of God. For I say that Christ 
Jesus was minister of the circumcision 
for the truth of God, to confirm the 
promises made unto the fathers: but 
that the Gentiles are to glorify God for 
His mercy, as it is written: Therefore 
will I confess to Thee, O Lord, among 
the Gentiles, and will sing to Thy 
Name. And again He saith: Rejoice, ye 
Gentiles, with His people. And again: 
Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and 
magnify Him, all ye people. And again, 
Isaias saith: There shall be a root of 
Jesse; and He that shall rise up to rule 
the Gentiles, in Him the Gentiles shall 
hope. Now the God of hope fill you with
all joy and peace in believing: that you 
may abound in hope, and in the power 
of the Holy Spirit.
