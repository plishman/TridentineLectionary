Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of 
Tiberius CÃ¦sar, Pontius Pilate being 
governor of Judea, and Herod being 
tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his 
brother tetrarch of Iturea and the 
country of Trachonitis, and Lysanias 
tetrarch of Abilina, under the high 
priests Annas and Caiphas: the word
of the Lord was made unto John, the 
son of Zachary, in the desert. And he 
came into all the country about the 
Jordan, preaching the baptism of 
penance for the remission of sins, as it 
was written in the book of the sayings 
of Isaias the prophet: A voice of one 
crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye 
the way of the Lord: make straight His 
paths: every valley shall be filled; and 
every mountain and hill shall be 
brought low, and the crooked shall be
made straight, and the rough ways 
plain: and all flesh shall see the 
salvation of God.
