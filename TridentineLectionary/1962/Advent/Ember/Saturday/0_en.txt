Come, O Lord, and show us Thy face,
Thou that sittest upon the Cherubim: 
and we shall be saved. (Ps 79: 2) 
Give ear, O Thou that rulest Israel: 
Thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Come, O 
Lord, and show us Thy face,
Thou that sittest upon the Cherubim: 
and we shall be saved.

<i>After the Kyrie eleison is said:</i>
Let us pray.
Let us kneel.
Arise.
