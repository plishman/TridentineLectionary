We beseech Thee, O Lord, our God, 
that the most holy Mysteries, which 
Thou hast given us for a safeguard of 
our renewal, may become our remedy 
both now and for time to come. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
