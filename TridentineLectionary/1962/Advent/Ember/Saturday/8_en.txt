Thus saith the Lord: Get thee up upon 
a high mountain, thou that bringest 
good tidings to Sion: lift up thy voice 
with strength, thou that bringest good 
tidings to Jerusalem: lift it up, fear not. 
Say to the cities of Juda: Behold your 
God: behold the Lord God shall come 
with strength, and His arm shall rule: 
behold His reward is with Him, and His 
work is before Him. He shall feed His 
flock like a shepherd: He shall gather 
together the lambs with His arm, and 
shall take them up in His bosom, the 
Lord our God.
