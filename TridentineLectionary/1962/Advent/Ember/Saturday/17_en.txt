Brethren, We beseech you by the 
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of
our gathering together unto Him: that 
you be not easily moved from your 
sense, nor be terrified, neither by spirit, 
nor by word, nor by epistle as sent from
us, as if the day of the Lord were at 
hand. Let no man deceive
you by any means: for unless there 
come a revolt first, and the man of sin 
be revealed, the son of perdition who 
opposeth and is lifted up above all that 
is called God or that is worshipped, so 
that he sitteth in the temple of God 
showing himself as if he were God. 
Remember you not that, when I was 
yet with you, I told you these things?
And now you know what withholdeth, 
that he may be revealed in his time. For
the mystery of iniquity already worketh: 
only that he who now holdeth do hold, 
until he be taken out of the way. And 
then that wicked one shall be revealed, 
whom the Lord Jesus shall kill with the 
spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy 
with the brightness of His coming.
