Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the coming solemnity of Thy 
Son, may both bestow upon us healing 
in this present life and grant to us 
rewards in the life to come. Through 
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee 
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
