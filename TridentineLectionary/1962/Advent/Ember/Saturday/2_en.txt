In those days they shall cry to the Lord
because of the oppressor, and He 
shall send them a Savior and a 
defender to deliver them. And the Lord 
shall be known by Egypt, and the 
Egyptians shall know the Lord in that 
day, and shall worship Him with 
sacrifices and offerings: and they shall 
make vows to the Lord and perform
them. And the Lord shall strike Egypt 
with a scourge, and shall heal it: and 
they shall return to the Lord, and He 
shall be pacified towards them, and the
Lord our God shall heal them.
