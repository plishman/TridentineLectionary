Thus saith the Lord to my anointed 
Cyrus: whose right hand I have taken 
hold of, to subdue nations before his 
face, and to turn the backs of kings, 
and to open the doors before him, and 
the gates shall not be shut. I will go 
before thee: and will humble the great 
ones of the earth: I will break in pieces 
the gates of brass, and will burst the 
bars of iron. And I will give thee hidden
treasures and the concealed riches of 
secret places: that thou mayest know 
that I am the Lord who call thee by thy 
name, the God of Israel. For the sake 
of My servant Jacob, and Israel My 
elect, I have even called Thee by thy 
name: I have made a likeness of thee, 
and thou hast not known Me. I am the 
Lord, and there is none else: there is 
no God besides Me: I girded thee, and 
thou hast not known Me: that they may
know who are from the rising of the 
sun, and they who are from the west, 
that there is none besides Me. I am the 
Lord, and there is none else: I form the 
light and create darkness, I make 
peace and create evil: I, the Lord, that 
do all these things. Drop down dew, ye
heavens, from above,
and let the clouds rain the just: let the
earth be opened and bud forth a 
Savior: and let justice spring up 
together: I the Lord have created Him.
