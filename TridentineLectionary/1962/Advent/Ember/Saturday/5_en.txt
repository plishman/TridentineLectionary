Thus saith the Lord: The land that was
desolate and impassable shall be glad,
and the wilderness shall rejoice and 
shall flourish like the lily. It shall bud 
forth and blossom, and shall rejoice 
with joy and praise: the glory of Libanus
is given to it: the beauty of Carmel, and
Saron, they shall see the glory of the 
Lord and the beauty of our God. 
Strengthen ye the feeble hands,
and confirm the weak knees. Say to the
faint hearted: Take courage, and fear 
not. Behold your God will bring the 
revenge of recompense: God Himself 
will come and will save you. Then shall 
the eyes of the blind be opened, and 
the ears of the deaf
shall be unstopped. Then shall the 
lame man leap as a hart, and the 
tongue of the dumb shall be free: for 
waters are broken out in the desert, 
and streams in the wilderness. And that
which was dry land shall become a 
pool, and the thirsty land springs of 
water: saith the Lord almighty.
