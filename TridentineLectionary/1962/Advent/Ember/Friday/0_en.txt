Thou art near, O Lord, and all Thy 
ways are truth: I have known from the 
beginning concerning Thy testimonies, 
and Thou art forever. (Ps. 118: 1) 
Blessed are the undefiled in the way; 
who walk in the way of the Lord. Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Thou art 
near, O Lord, and all Thy ways are 
truth: I have known from the beginning 
concerning Thy testimonies, and Thou 
art forever.
