Thus saith the Lord God: There shall 
come forth a rod out of the root of 
Jesse, and a flower shall rise up out of 
his root. And the Spirit of the Lord shall 
rest upon Him: the spirit of wisdom and
of understanding, the spirit of counsel 
and of fortitude, the spirit of knowledge 
and of godliness, and He shall be filled 
with the spirit of the fear of the Lord. 
He shall not judge according to the 
sight of the eyes, nor reprove 
according to the hearing of the ears. 
But He shall judge the poor with 
justice, and shall reprove with equity 
for the meek of the earth: and He shall 
strike the earth with the rod of His 
mouth, and with the breath of His lips 
He shall slay the wicked. And justice 
shall be the girdle of His loins: and faith
the girdle of His reins.
