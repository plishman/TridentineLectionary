In those days the Lord spoke to Achaz,
saying: Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy 
God, either unto the depth of hell, or 
unto the height above. And Achaz said:
I will not ask, and I will not tempt the 
Lord. And He said: Hear ye therefore, 
O house of David: Is it a small thing for 
you to be grievous to men, that you are
grievous to my God also? Therefore 
the Lord Himself shall give you a sign. 
Behold a Virgin shall conceive and 
bear a Son, and His Name shall be 
called Emmanuel. He shall eat butter 
and honey, that He may know to refuse
the evil, and to choose the good.
