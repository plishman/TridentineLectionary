At that time the Angel Gabriel was sent 
from God into a city of Galilee, called 
Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a 
man whose name was Joseph, of the 
house of David, and the virgin's name 
was Mary. And the Angel being come 
in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace: the 
Lord is with thee: blessed art thou 
among women. Who having heard, was
troubled at his saying: and thought with
herself what manner of salutation this 
should be. And the Angel said to her: 
Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found 
grace with God: behold thou shalt 
conceive in thy womb, and shall bring 
forth a son, and thou shalt call His 
name Jesus. He shall be great, and 
shall be called the Son of the Most 
High, and the Lord God shall give unto 
Him the throne of David His father; and 
He shall reign in the house of Jacob for
ever, and of His kingdom there shall be 
no end. And Mary said to the Angel: 
How shall this be done, because I know
not man? And the Angel answering, 
said to her: The Holy Spirit shall come 
upon thee, and the power of the Most 
High shall overshadow thee. And 
therefore also the Holy which shall be 
born of thee shall be called the Son of 
God. And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, 
she also hath conceived a son in her 
old age; and this is the sixth month with
her that is called barren; because no 
work shall be impossible with God. And
Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the 
Lord, be it done to me according to thy 
word.
