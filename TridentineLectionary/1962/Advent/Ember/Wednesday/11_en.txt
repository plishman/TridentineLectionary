It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation, that we should at all 
times and places give thanks unto 
Thee, O holy Lord, almighty Father, 
eternal God, through Christ our Lord; 
for in Thy mercy and fidelity Thou hast 
promised Him as Savior to the lost race
of men, to instruct the ignorant with His 
truth, justify the wicked with His 
holiness, and help the weak by His 
power. Now that the time draweth nigh 
that He Whom Thou art to send should 
come, and the day of our liberation 
should dawn, with faith in Thy 
promises, we rejoice with holy 
exultation. And therefore with the 
Angels and Archangels, with the 
Thrones and Dominations, and with all 
the hosts of the heavenly army, we sing
a hymn of Thy glory, evermore saying:
