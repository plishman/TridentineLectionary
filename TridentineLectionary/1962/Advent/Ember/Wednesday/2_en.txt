Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the coming solemnity of our 
redemption may both confer upon us 
assistance in this present life and 
bestow the rewards of everlasting 
blessedness. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, who lives and reigns 
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
