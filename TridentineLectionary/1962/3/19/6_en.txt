When Mary the mother of Jesus was 
espoused to Joseph, before they came 
together, she was found with child of 
the Holy Ghost. Whereupon Joseph her
husband, being a just man and not 
willing publicly to expose her, was 
minded to put her away privately. But 
while he thought on these things, 
behold the Angel of the Lord appeared 
to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, son
of David, fear not to take unto
thee Mary thy wife: for that which is 
conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 
And she shall bring forth a Son, and 
thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He 
shall save His people from their sins.
