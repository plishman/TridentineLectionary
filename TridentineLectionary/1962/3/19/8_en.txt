We render unto Thee, O Lord, the duty 
of our service, humbly entreating Thee 
to preserve Thine own gifts within us
through the prayers of blessed Joseph,
Spouse of the Mother of Thy Son Jesus
Christ our Lord, on whose holy festival 
we offer to Thee this sacrifice of praise.
Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, our Lord, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
