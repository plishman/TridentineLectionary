(If the feast of St. Joseph falls on Passion Sunday, it is celebrated on the 
subsequent Monday. If it falls during Holy Week, it is celebrated on the 
Wednesday after Low Sunday in Paschal time.)
Joseph, says the Holy Scripture, was a just man; he was innocent and pure;
he was gentle and tender; he was prudent and a lover of silence; above all he 
was faithful and obedient to divine calls. Devotion to St. Joseph has developed 
among Christian people in so marvelous a manner, following such wonderful 
laws, that it is impossible not to recognize therein the working of Divine 
Providence.
In the early Church the festivals were such as referred to the mystery of the 
salvation of the world. The golden period of devotion to Mary began with the 
Council of Ephesus. Second only to Mary comes Joseph who although not the 
Father of Jesus, had a father's authority over Him. He was invested with this 
authority by the Eternal Father. The commands of God to the Holy Family were 
delivered by an angel to Joseph. During the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries 
devotion to him grew rapidly fostered by St. Bridget of Sweden and St. 
Bernardine of Sienna.
Pius IX declared Joseph "Patron of the Universal Church." On November 
13, 1962, Pope John XXIII took the unprecedented step of adding St. Joseph's 
name to the Canon of the Mass.
