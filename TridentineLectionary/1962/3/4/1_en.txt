O God, Who didst fortify holy Casimir 
with the virtue of constancy in the midst
of kingly delights and the world's 
allurements, through his intercession 
we beseech Thee that Thy faithful may 
scorn earthly things and ever aspire to 
those of heaven. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Eternal Shepherd, regard graciously 
Thy flock, and keep it with an 
everlasting protection, by the 
intercession of blessed Lucius, Thy 
Martyr and Sovereign Pontiff, whom 
Thou hast constituted shepherd of the 
whole Church. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
