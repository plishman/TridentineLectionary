The festival of this saint, who preserved a virginal purity in the midst of the 
frivolities of a royal court (died 1483), was instituted by Paul V. He practiced 
bodily mortification in a high degree, gave abundant alms and meditated 
continually on the sufferings of Christ.
(Commemoration of St. Lucius) St. Lucius, Pope and Martyr, is praised 
greatly by St. Cyprian for his manner of dealing with lapsed Christians; he was 
exiled from Rome almost immediately after he became bishop; he lived only a 
few weeks after his return.
