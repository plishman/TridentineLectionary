Hearken, O daughter, and see, incline 
thy ear: for the King hath greatly 
desired thy beauty. (Ps. 44: 13, 10) All 
the rich shall entreat thy countenance: 
the daughters of kings in thine honor. 
(Ps. 44: 15-16) After her shall virgins 
be brought to the King: her neighbors 
shall be brought to thee. They shall be 
brought with gladness and rejoicing: 
they shall be brought into the temple of 
the King.
