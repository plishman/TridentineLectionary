Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
Thy grace into our hearts: that we, to 
whom the Incarnation of Christ Thy Son
was made known by the message of an
Angel, may by His Passion and Cross 
be brought to the glory of the 
Resurrection. Through the same Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
