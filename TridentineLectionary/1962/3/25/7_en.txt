Strengthen in our minds, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, the mysteries of the true 
faith; that we who confess Him who 
was conceived of a Virgin to be true 
God and man, may deserve by the 
power of His saving resurrection to 
attain to eternal happiness. Through 
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
