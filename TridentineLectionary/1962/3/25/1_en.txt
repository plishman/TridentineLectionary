O God, who didst will that Thy Word 
should take flesh, at the message of an
Angel, in the womb of the Blessed 
Virgin Mary, grant to Thy suppliant 
people, that we who believe her to be 
truly the Mother of God, may be helped
by her intercession with Thee. Through
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
