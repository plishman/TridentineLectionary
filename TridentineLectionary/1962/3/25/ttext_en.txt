This ancient feast, like that of Christmas, was considered originally as a 
feast of Our Lord, rather than of the Blessed Virgin. It has been fixed on the date
of March 25, since before the Seventh Century.
At the High Mass on this day the celebrant and his ministers kneel on the 
altar steps during the singing of the Et incarnatus est, in the Nicene Creed.
(If the feast falls on Passion Sunday, it is celebrated on the following Monday. If 
it falls in Holy or Easter week it is celebrated on the Monday after Low Sunday.)
