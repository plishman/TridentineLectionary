St. Boniface, a Roman martyr, suffered at Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, at the
beginning of the Fourth Century. He had gone thither, as a penance for the sins 
of his past life, to recover relics of the saints. After his martyrdom, his body was 
taken back to Rome and enshrined in a church that was erected in his honor.
