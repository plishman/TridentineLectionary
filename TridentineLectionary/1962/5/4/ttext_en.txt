St. Monica, born in Africa, married a pagan whom she converted. As 
described in the ninth book of his Confessions, the beautiful figure of the mother
of St. Augustine will continue to live in the Church as one of the finest examples 
of a Christian mother; night and day she prayed for her son. He tells us that she
"shed for him more tears than other mothers shed over a coffin." God heard her 
prayers after twenty years and gave to her son, under the influence of St. 
Ambrose, the grace of conversion. She died at Ostia in 387, after God had 
granted to her and to Augustine a marvelous ecstasy.
The body of St. Monica remained at Ostia until the year 1162, when a 
certain Walter Prior, of the Canons Regular of Aroasia, in Belgium, removed the 
body secretly from its tomb and carried it off to his own monastery. The 
celebration of her feast on the 4th of May spread from this monastery through 
Belgium, Germany and France and thus came into general liturgical use.
