O God, the consoler of them that 
mourn and the health of them that hope
in Thee, Who didst show Thine 
acceptance of blessed Monica's pious 
tears in the conversion of her son 
Augustine, grant us, by the intercession
of them both, to deplore our sins and 
find the mercy of Thy grace. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
