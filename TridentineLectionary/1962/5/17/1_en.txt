O God, Who didst adorn blessed 
Paschal, Thy confessor, with a 
wonderful love for the sacred 
mysteries of Thy body and blood, 
mercifully grant that we, too, may be 
worthy to feel the same unction of the 
spirit which he received from this divine
banquet. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
