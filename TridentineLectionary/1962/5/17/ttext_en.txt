St. Paschal Baylon, was a simple lay brother of the Franciscan Order, and, 
by preference, occupied himself with the roughest and most servile tasks. He 
was distinguished by an ardent love and devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. He
died in the odor of sanctity; May 15, 1592. Even after death his body moved 
and his eyes opened in an act of adoration when the priest raised up the sacred 
host at the elevation in the Mass. Pope Leo XIII declared him protector of all 
Eucharistic Congresses and works.
