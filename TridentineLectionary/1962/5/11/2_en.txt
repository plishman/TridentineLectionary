Brethren, to every one of us is given 
grace according to the measure of the 
giving of Christ. Wherefore He saith, 
Ascending on high, He led captivity 
captive; He gave gifts to men. Now, 
that He ascended, what is it, but 
because He also descended first into 
the lower parts of the earth? He that 
descended is the same also that 
ascended above all the heavens, that 
He might fill all things. And He gave 
some apostles, and some prophets, 
and other some evangelists, and other 
some pastors and doctors, for the 
perfecting of the saints, for the work of 
the ministry, for the edifying of the body
of Christ; until we all meet into the unity
of faith, and of the knowledge of the 
Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto 
the measure of the age of the fullness 
of Christ.
