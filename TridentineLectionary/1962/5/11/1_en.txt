O God, Who dost gladden us with the 
annual solemnity of Thine apostles, 
Philip and James, grant, we beseech 
Thee, that we may learn from the 
examples of those in whose merits we 
rejoice. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
