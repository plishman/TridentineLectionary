At that time Jesus said to His disciples: 
Let not your heart be troubled: you 
believe in God, believe also in Me. In 
My Father's house there are many 
mansions. If not, I would have told you, 
that I go to prepare a place for you. And
if I shall go and prepare a place for you,
I will come again and will take you to 
Myself, that where I am you also may 
be. And whither I go you know, and the 
way you know. Thomas saith to Him, 
Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; 
and how can we know the way? Jesus 
saith to him, I am the way, and the 
truth, and the life. No man cometh to 
the Father, but by Me. If you had known
Me, you would without doubt have 
known My Father also: and from 
henceforth you shall know Him; and 
you have seen Him. Philip saith to Him,
Lord, show us the Father, and it is 
enough for us. Jesus saith to him, So 
long a time have I been with you, and 
have you not known Me? Philip, he that
seeth Me, seeth the Father also. How 
sayest thou, show us the Father? Do 
you not believe that I am in the Father, 
and the Father in Me? The words that I 
speak to you, I speak not of Myself. But
the Father Who abideth in Me, He 
doeth the works. Believe you not that I 
am in the Father, and the Father in Me?
Otherwise, believe for the very works' 
sake. Amen, amen, I say to you, he that
believeth in Me, the works that I do, he 
also shall do; and greater than these 
shall he do. Because I go to the Father:
and whatsoever you shall ask the 
Father in My name, that will I do.
