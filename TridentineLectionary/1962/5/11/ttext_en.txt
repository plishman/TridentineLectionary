In the Church of the Twelve Apostles in Rome there were some relics of the 
apostles Philip and James the Just (or Less). Because of the consecration of 
the Church of the Holy Apostles on May 1, and the relics of St. James preserved
in this Church, the feast of James the Less was joined with that of St. Philip and 
celebrated on this day. The stational mass is said here on all Fridays in ember 
week and on Easter Thursday.
The apostle St. Philip was one of the first chosen disciples of Christ. He 
preached the Gospel in Eastern Europe, and in Phrygia, and in the end suffered 
death by crucifixion. St. James governed the Church of Jerusalem for nearly 
thirty years, until about A.D. 62, when he was stoned to death by the Jews. 
With the coming of the feast of St. Joseph the Worker to May 1, the feast of Sts. 
James and Philp was moved to this day in the calendar.
