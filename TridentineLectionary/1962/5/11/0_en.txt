In the time of their tribulation they cried 
to Thee, O Lord, and Thou heard them 
from heaven, alleluia, alleluia.
(Ps. 32: 1) Exult, you just, in the Lord; 
praise from the upright is fitting. Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. In the time 
of their tribulation they cried to Thee, O 
Lord, and Thou heard them from 
heaven, alleluia, alleluia.
