At that time, Jesus coming into His 
country, He taught them in their 
synagogues, so that they wondered 
and said: How came this man by this 
wisdom and miracles? Is not this the 
carpenter's son? Is not His mother 
called Mary, and His brethren James, 
and Joseph, and Simon, and Jude: and
His sisters, are they not all with us? 
Whence therefore hath He all these 
things? And they were scandalized in 
His regard. But Jesus said to them: A 
prophet is not without honour, save in 
his own country, and in his own house. 
And He wrought not many miracles 
there, because of their unbelief.
