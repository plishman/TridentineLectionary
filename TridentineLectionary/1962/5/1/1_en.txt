O God, Creator of all things, Who dost 
impose on man the law of work; grant 
in Thy goodness that, by the example 
and patronage of blessed Joseph, we 
may both accomplish the work Thou 
dost command and attain the reward 
Thou hast promised. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
