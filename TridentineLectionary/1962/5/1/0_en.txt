Wisdom rendered to the just the wages
of their labors, and conducted them in a
wonderful way: and she was to them 
for a covert by day, and for the light of 
stars by night. Alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 
126: 1) Unless the Lord build the 
house, they labor in vain that build it. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Wisdom 
rendered to the just the wages of their 
labors, and conducted them in a 
wonderful way: and she was to them 
for a covert by day, and for the light of 
stars by night. Alleluia, alleluia.
