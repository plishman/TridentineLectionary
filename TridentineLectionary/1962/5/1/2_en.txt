Brethren: Have charity, which is the 
bond of perfection. And let the peace of
Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein 
also you are called in one body: and be
ye thankful. All whatsoever you do in 
word or in work, do all in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to 
God and the Father by Him. 
Whatsoever you do, do it from the 
heart, as to the Lord, and not to men: 
knowing that you shall receive of the 
Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve 
ye the Lord Christ.
