In the midst of the Church he opened 
his mouth: and the Lord filled him with 
the spirit of wisdom and understanding.
He clothed him with a robe of glory. 
Alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 91: 2) It is good 
to give praise to the Lord: and to sing to
Thy Name, O Most High. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. In the midst of the Church 
he opened his mouth: and the Lord 
filled him with the spirit of wisdom and 
understanding. He clothed him with a 
robe of glory. Alleluia, alleluia.
