We offer this sacrifice unto Thee, O 
Lord, for an odor of sweetness; grant 
that, taught by the instruction and 
example of blessed Robert, we may 
with enlarged heart run the way of Thy 
commandments. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
