St. Robert Bellarmine, of whom Pope Clement VIII said: "The Church of God
had not his equal in learning," was born in 1542 at Montepulciano and died in 
1621. He entered the Society of Jesus, was made a Cardinal, and distinguished
himself by his teaching, preaching, writing, and defense of the rights of the 
Church. During St. Aloysius' last years, St. Robert was his spiritual director. He 
was beatified in 1923, canonized and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1931. 
He is the patron of catechetical instruction.
