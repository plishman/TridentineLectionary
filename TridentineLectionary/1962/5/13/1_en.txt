O God, who didst adorn blessed 
Robert, Thy Bishop and Doctor, with 
marvelous learning and virtue to 
expose the deceptions of error and to 
defend the rights of the Apostolic see, 
grant that, by his merits and 
intercession, love for the truth may 
increase in us and the souls of the 
erring may return to the unity of Thy 
Church. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
