May the sacraments which we have 
received, O Lord, our God, inflame us 
with that fire of love which ardently 
consumed blessed Robert and led him 
to spend himself continually for Thy 
Church. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
