I wished, and understanding was given 
me; and I called, and the spirit of 
wisdom came upon me; and I 
preferred her before kingdoms and 
thrones, and esteemed riches nothing 
in comparison of her. Neither did I 
compare unto her any precious stone, 
for all gold in comparison of her is as a 
little sand, and silver in respect to her 
shall be counted as clay. I loved her 
above health and beauty, and chose to
have her instead of light, for her light 
cannot be put out. Now all good things
came to me together with her, and 
innumerable riches through her hands. 
And I rejoiced in them all; for
this wisdom went before me, and I 
knew not that she was the mother of 
them all; which I have learned without 
guile, and communicate without envy, 
and her riches I hide not; for she is an 
infinite treasure to men, which they 
that use, become the friends of God, 
being commended for the gifts of 
discipline.
