O Lord, we beseech Thee, graciously 
govern Thy Church, which Thou hast 
fed with a holy meal; so that, directed 
by a mighty wisdom, she may progress 
in liberty, and persist in the integrity of 
faith. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
Increase within Thy Church, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, the gift of grace
Thou hast given her, and through the 
prayers of blessed Urban, Thy Martyr 
and Supreme Pontiff, may the flock 
never fail in obedience to the shepherd 
nor the shepherd in the faithful care of 
his flock. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
