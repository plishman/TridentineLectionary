St. Gregory VII was one of the most famous of the successors of St. Peter.
He was born at the foot of the Capitol, near the deaconry of St. Mary in Portico, 
which he caused to be restored after he had become Pope, reconsecrating the 
high altar. In his early youth he was professed in the Order of St. Benedict in the
little monastery of St. Mary on the Aventine, where the Priory of the Knights of 
Malta now stands. He was elected Pope in 1073, and his conflicts with Henry IV,
Emperor of Germany, have made his name immortal throughout the whole 
Christian world. On May 25, 1085, in the twelfth year of his pontificate, Gregory 
entered into his rest. He died in exile at Salerno, where his body is buried in the 
Cathedral.
Commemoration of St. Urban I, Pope, Martyr: St. Urban, who succeeded St. 
Calixtus in the year 223, was Pope for seven years. He suffered martyrdom 
under Emperor Alexander Severus.
