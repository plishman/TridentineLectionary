O God, the strength of them that trust 
in Thee, Who didst fortify blessed 
Gregory, Thy Confessor and Pontiff, 
with the virtue of constancy, for the 
defense of the liberty of the Church, 
grant us by his example and 
intercession courageously to overcome
all adversities. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
O God, Who firmly established Thy 
Church upon the rock of the apostle 
and delivered her from the dreadful 
powers of hell, grant, we beseech 
Thee, that through the intercession of 
blessed Urban, Thy Martyr and 
Supreme Pontiff, she may remain 
faithful to Thy truth so as to be always 
safe under Thy protection. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
