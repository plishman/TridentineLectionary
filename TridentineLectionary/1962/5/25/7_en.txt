By the offered gifts we beg Thee, O 
Lord: enlighten kindly Thy Church: so 
that Thy flock everywhere may be 
increasing, and the Shepherds, under 
Thy direction, may be pleasing to Thy 
Name. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
Receive, O Lord, in Thy loving 
kindness the joyful offering of our gifts, 
and through the intercession of blessed
Urban grant that Thy Church may enjoy
integrity of faith and always rejoice in 
the tranquility of peaceful times. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
