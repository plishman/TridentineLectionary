Happy the man found without fault, who
turns not aside after gain, nor puts his 
trust in money nor in treasures! Who is 
he, that we may praise him? For he has
done wonders in his life. He has been 
tested by gold and come off safe, and 
this remains his glory forever; he could 
have sinned but did not, could have 
done evil but would not, so that his 
possessions are secure in the Lord, 
and the assembly of the Saints shall 
recount his alms.
