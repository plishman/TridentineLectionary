O Lord, Jesus Who bestowed on 
blessed Bernardine, Thy Confessor, an 
unusual love for Thine holy name, we 
beseech Thee, by his merits and 
intercession, graciously pour upon us 
the spirit of Thy love. Who lives and 
reigns with God the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
