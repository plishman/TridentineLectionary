Then shall the just stand with great 
constancy against those that have 
afflicted them and taken away their 
labors. These seeing it, shall be 
troubled with terrible fear, and shall be 
amazed at the suddenness of their 
unexpected salvation, saying within 
themselves, repenting, and groaning 
for anguish of spirit: These are they 
whom we had some time in derision 
and for a parable of reproach. We fools
esteemed their life madness and their 
end without honor; behold how they are
numbered among the children of God, 
and their lot is among the Saints.
