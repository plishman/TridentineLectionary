At that time, the mother of the sons of 
Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, 
worshiping, and asking something of 
Him. Who said to her: What wilt thou? 
She saith to Him: Say that these my 
two sons may sit, the one on Thy right 
hand, and the other on Thy left, in Thy 
kingdom. And Jesus answering, said: 
You know not what you ask, can you 
drink the chalice that I shall drink? 
They saith to Him: We can. He saith to 
them: My chalice indeed you shall 
drink; but to sit on my right or left hand 
is not Mine to give to you, but to them 
for whom it is prepared by My Father.
