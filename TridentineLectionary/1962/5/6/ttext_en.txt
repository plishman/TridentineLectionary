Besides the solemn feast two days after Christmas, the Church 
commemorates the attempt to put St. John to death in a caldron of boiling oil 
outside the Latin Gate. The saint came from it unhurt, and even more vigorous 
than before. A church now marks the site which a late tradition assigns to this 
event. This feast celebrates the martyrdom of the evangelist who, according to 
the prophecy of the Savior, was also, like his brother, to drink of the chalice of 
the Passion, in order that he might have the right to one of the highest thrones 
in the Messianic kingdom, which his mother had begged for him.
