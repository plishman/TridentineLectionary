O God, Who beholdest that our own ill 
deeds disquiet us on every side, grant, 
we beseech Thee, that the glorious 
intercession of blessed John,Thine 
apostle and evangelist, may be our 
protection. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
