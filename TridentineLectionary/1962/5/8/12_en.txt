May the prayer, O Lord, of Blessed 
Mary, Thy Mother and our Mediatrix, 
assist us: that through the bestowal of 
Thy grace, and these most holy 
mysteries, we may attain to an increase
of everlasting redemption: Who lives 
and reigns with God the Father in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
