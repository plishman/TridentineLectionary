All ye that thirst, come ye to the waters;
and you that have no money, make 
haste, buy and eat. Come ye: buy wine
and milk without money and without 
any price. Why do you spend money 
for that which is not bread, and your 
labor for that which does not satisfy? 
Hearken diligently to me and eat that 
which is good, and your soul shall be 
delighted in fatness. Incline your ear 
and come to me: hear and your soul 
shall live. Behold thou shalt call a 
nation, which thou knewest not: and the
nations that knew not thee shall run to 
thee, because of the Lord, thy God, 
and for the holy One of Israel, for He 
hath glorified thee.
