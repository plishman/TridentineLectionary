Let us go with confidence to the throne 
of grace, that we may obtain mercy and
find grace in seasonable aid. (P.T. 
Alleluia, alleluia.) (Ps. 120: 1) I have 
lifted up my eyes to the mountains; 
from thence help will come to me. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Let us go 
with confidence to the throne of grace, 
that we may obtain mercy and find 
grace in seasonable aid. (P.T. Alleluia, 
alleluia.)
