O Lord Jesus Christ, our Mediator with 
the Father, who hast appointed the 
most Blessed Virgin, Thy Mother, to be 
also our Mother, and our mediatrix with 
Thee: grant that whosoever shall 
approach Thee for some favor, may 
rejoice at obtaining all things through 
her: Who lives and reigns with God the 
Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
