Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that as we thank Thee for the 
favors we have received, we may, by 
the intercession of blessed 
Antoninus,Thy Confessor and Bishop, 
obtain still greater blessings. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.

O almighty God, we beseech Thee, 
that, through the prayers of Thy holy 
martyrs Gordian and Epimachus, the 
Heavenly food of which we have 
partaken, may be our sure defense in 
all adversity. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
