May we be assisted, O Lord, by the 
merits of St. Antoninus, Thy confessor 
and bishop, that, as we declare Thee 
wonderful in him, so we may glory in 
Thy mercy toward us. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Gordian & 
Epimachus)(Commemoration of Sts. Gordian & 
Epimachus)
Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we, who venerate the festival 
of Thy blessed martyrs Gordian and 
Epimachus, may be helped by their 
intercession with Thee. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
