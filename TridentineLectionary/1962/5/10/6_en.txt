May Thy saints, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, everywhere make us joyful, that, 
while we venerate their merits, we may 
experience their patronage. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Gordian & 
Epimachus)(Commemoration of Sts. Gordian & 
Epimachus)
Graciously receive, O Lord, these 
offerings, which we dedicate to Thee 
relying on the merits of Thy holy 
martyrs Godrian and Epimachus: and 
grant that they may become for us an 
everlasting help. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
