St. Antoninus entered the Dominican Order in his sixteenth year. In 1446 he 
was compelled to accept the archbishopric of Florence. When the false 
Renaissance was beginning to give a tone of classical paganism to society, he 
set an example of fervent pastoral zeal, joined with the love of study and of the 
most austere virtues of the cloister. He died in 1459.
Commemoration of Gordian & Epimachus. Under Pope Adrian I the bodies 
of these two martyrs were placed in the same tomb. Gordian was a Roman 
judge converted by a holy priest who was brought before him for trial under 
Julian the Apostate. St. Epimachus was an Alexandrian martyr who at first had a
separate mass in the Liturgy.
