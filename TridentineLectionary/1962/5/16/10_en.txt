Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that as we thank Thee for the 
favors we have received, we may, by 
the intercession of blessed Ubald,Thy 
Confessor and Bishop, obtain still 
greater blessings. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
