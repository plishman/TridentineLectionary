Be pleased to bestow upon us Thine 
assistance, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
and, by the intercession of blessed 
Ubald, Thy confessor and bishop, 
stretch forth over us the right hand of 
Thy mercy against all the craft of the 
devil. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
