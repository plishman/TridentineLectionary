O God, who didst give blessed Gregory
as a minister of eternal salvation to Thy
people: grant, we beseech Thee, that 
we, who have had him for our teacher 
on earth, may deserve to have him for 
our advocate in heaven. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
