The just man will give his heart to 
resort early to the Lord that made him, 
and he will pray in the sight of the Most 
High. He will open his mouth in prayer, 
and will make supplication for his sins. 
For if it shall please the great Lord, He 
will fill him with the spirit of 
understanding: and he will pour forth 
the words of His wisdom as showers, 
and in his prayer he will confess to the 
Lord. And He shall direct his counsel, 
and his knowledge, and in His secrets 
shall he meditate. He shall show forth 
the discipline he hath learned, and shall
glory in the law of the covenant of the 
Lord. Many shall praise his wisdom, 
and it shall never be forgotten. The 
memory of him shall not pass away, 
and his name shall be in request from 
generation to generation. Nations shall 
declare his wisdom, and the Church 
shall show forth his praise.
