St. Gregory of Nazianzen, one of the Fathers of the Greek Church, was 
born in Asia Minor; he was made a bishop and afterward Patriarch of 
Constantinople. He labored with wonderful success against the Arians. His 
success drew on him the hatred of the enemies of the Faith. Finally, he resigned
his See and retired to his native town, where he died in 390. As a champion of 
the Faith he was so well equipped, so strenuous, and so exact that he is called 
St. Gregory the Theologian. His firmness restored the Faith of the Council of 
Nicea to Constantinople; he was, however, a man of gentle spirit and eminently 
poetic mind. Renouncing his bishopric, he set his heart on the contemplative life
and monastic discipline.
