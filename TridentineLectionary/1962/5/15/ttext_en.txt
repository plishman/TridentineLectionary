St. John Baptist de la Salle was canonized by Leo XIII, who also extended 
the observance of his feast to the Universal Church. His place in ecclesiastical 
history is chiefly important from the social point of view. Since at least two 
centuries before world changes rendered necessary the education of the 
masses, and before technical schools had gained for themselves the 
all-important place in the training of the young, which had up till then been held 
exclusively by classical teaching, God gave him an intuition of this need as 
though by a prophetic vision. St. John Baptist de la Salle, answering the divine
call, resigned his honorable position as a canon of Rheims, and, overcoming 
much opposition and many difficulties, founded the Society of the Brothers of 
Christian Schools, which still is productive of so much good throughout the
Church. He died at Rouen on Good Friday, April 7, 1719, at the age of 68.
