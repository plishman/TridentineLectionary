The mouth of the just shall meditate 
wisdom, and his tongue shall speak 
judgment: the law of his God is in his 
heart. (P.T. Alleluia, alleluia) (Ps. 36: 1)
Be not emulous of evildoers: nor envy 
them that work iniquity. Glory be to the 
Father and to the Son and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. The mouth of the just shall 
meditate wisdom, and his tongue shall 
speak judgment: the law of his God is 
in his heart. (P.T. Alleluia, alleluia)
