O God, Who, for the Christian 
instruction of the poor, and the 
strengthening of the young in the way 
of truth, didst raise up St. John Baptist, 
the confessor, and, through him, didst 
gather a new family within Thy Church, 
mercifully grant that, by his intercession
and example, fervent in zeal for Thy 
glory and the salvation of souls, we 
may be enabled to become sharers of 
his crown in heaven. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
