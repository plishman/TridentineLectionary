St. Bede, the illustrious ornament of the Anglo-Saxon Church and the first 
English historian, is universally known as "Venerable Bede." He was declared a 
Doctor of the Church by Pope Leo IIl. He trained six hundred scholars, who 
were attached to him by his piety, learning, and sweet disposition. He left 
beautiful lives of Anglo-Saxon saints, and his commentaries on the Scriptures 
are still in use by the Church.
He died May 26, 735. Historians relate of him that he passed no time in 
idleness and never ceased to study; he always read, always wrote, always 
thought, and always prayed.
Commemoration of St. John I, Pope, Martyr: St. John was Pope during the reign
of Theodoric, the Arian king of the Goths, who cast him into a dungeon at 
Ravenna, where he died from his sulIerings, May 27, 526. His body was carried
