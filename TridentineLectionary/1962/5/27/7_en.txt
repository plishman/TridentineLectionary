May the holy prayer of St. Bede, Thy 
Confessor and Doctor, fail us not, O 
Lord: may it render our offerings 
acceptable, and ever obtain for us Thy 
pardon. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
In Thy loving kindness, we beseech 
Thee, Lord, be moved by the offering of
our gifts and enlighten Thy Church: that
Thy flock may prosper everywhere and
the shepherds, under Thy guidance, 
may be rendered acceptable to Thee. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
