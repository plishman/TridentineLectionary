O God, Who by the learning of blessed
Bede, Thy Confessor and Doctor, hast 
glorified Thy Church: grant that Thy 
servants may ever be enlightened by 
his wisdom and helped by his merits. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
O Eternal Shepherd, do Thou look 
favorably upon Thy flock, which we 
beseech Thee to guard and keep for 
evermore through the Blessed John 
Thy Martyr and Supreme Pontiff, 
whom Thou didst choose to be the 
chief shepherd of the whole Church. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
