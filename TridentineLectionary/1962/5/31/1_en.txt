Grant us, we beseech Thee, Lord, that 
we who celebrate the festival of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary our Queen, may, 
by her assistance, obtain peace in this 
life and glory in the next. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Harken unto us, O God, our Savior that
as we rejoice in the festival of blessed 
Petronilla, Thy virgin, so we may be 
instructed by the affection of pious 
devotion. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
