Let us all rejoice in the Lord, 
celebrating a feast in honor of the 
Queenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary: 
at whose solemnity the angels rejoice 
and join in praising the Son of God. 
(Ps. 44: 2) My heart hath uttered a 
good word; I speak my works to the 
King. Glory be to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in 
the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. Let us 
all rejoice in the Lord, celebrating a 
feast in honor of the Queenship of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary: at whose 
solemnity the angels rejoice and join in 
praising the Son of God.
