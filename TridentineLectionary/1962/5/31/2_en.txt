I came out of the mouth of the Most 
High, the firstborn before all creatures. I
dwelt in the highest places, and my 
throne is in a pillar of cloud. And I have
stood in all the earth and in every 
people, and in every nation I have had 
the chief rule. And by my power I have 
trodden under my feet the hearts of all 
the high and low. He that harkeneth to 
me shall not be confounded, and they 
that work by me shall not sin. They that
explain me shall have life everlasting.
