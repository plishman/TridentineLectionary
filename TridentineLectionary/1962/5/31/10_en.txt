With joy we have celebrated these 
mysteries, O Lord, on the feast of the 
blessed Virgin Mary, our Queen; we 
beseech Thee that as they have been 
performed with joy in her honor, so by 
her intercession they may avail for our 
salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Thou hast filled Thy household, O Lord,
with sacred gifts; ever comfort us, we 
beseech Thee, through her 
intercession whose festival we 
celebrate. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
