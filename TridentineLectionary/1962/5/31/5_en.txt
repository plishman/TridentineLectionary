At that time, the angel Gabriel was sent
from God into a city of Galilee, called 
Nazareth, to virgin espoused to man 
whose name was Joseph, of the house 
of David: and the virgin's name was 
Mary. And the angel being come in, 
said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the 
Lord is with thee: blessed art thou 
among women. Who having heard, was
troubled at his saying and thought with 
herself what manner of salutation this 
should be. And the angel said to her: 
Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found 
grace with God. Behold thou shalt 
conceive in thy womb and shalt bring 
forth a Son; and thou shalt call his 
name Jesus. He shall be great and 
shall be called the Son of the Most 
High, and the Lord God shall give unto 
Him the throne of David His father: and 
He shall reign in the house of Jacob 
forever, and of His kingdom there shall 
be no end.
