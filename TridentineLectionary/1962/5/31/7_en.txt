Receive, O Lord, we implore Thee, the 
gifts of Thy rejoicing Church, and grant 
that through the merits of the blessed 
Virgin Mary, our Queen, they may avail 
to our salvation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
May the offering of Thy consecrated 
people be accepted by Thee, O Lord, in
honor of Thy saints, by whose merits it 
knoweth that it hath received aid in time
of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
