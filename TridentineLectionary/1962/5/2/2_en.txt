Brethren, We preach not ourselves, but
Jesus Christ our Lord; and ourselves 
your servants through Jesus. For God,
Who commanded the light to shine out
of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, 
to give the light of the knowledge of 
the glory of God, in the face of Christ 
Jesus. But we have this treasure in 
earthen vessels, that the excellency 
may be of the power of God and not of
us. In all things we suffer tribulation, but
are not distressed; we are straitened, 
but are not destitute; we suffer 
persecution, but are not forsaken; we 
are cast down, but we perish not; 
always bearing about in our body the 
mortification of Jesus, that the life also 
of Jesus may be made manifest in our 
bodies. For we who live are always 
delivered unto death for Jesus' sake; 
that the life also of Jesus, may be 
made manifest in our mortal flesh. So 
then death worketh in us, but life in 
you. But having the same spirit of 
faith, as it is written, I believed, for 
which cause I have spoken, we also 
believe, for which cause we speak 
also: knowing that He who raised up 
Jesus will raise up us also with Jesus, 
and place us with you.
