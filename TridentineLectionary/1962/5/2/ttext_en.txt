St. Athanasius, Doctor of the Church and Patriarch of Alexandria, one of the 
most renowned of the Fathers of the Church, was the heroic and successful 
defender of Catholic doctrine against Arius. After many sufferings in the cause of
God's Church, he died May 2, 373.
While living in Rome during his exile he described to the Romans the 
wonderful life of Antony and Pachomius in Egypt, sowing the seed of 
monasticism in Rome. He taught with great power the independence of the 
Church from civil authority.
