At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
When they shall persecute you in this 
city, flee to another. Amen, I say to 
you, you shall not finish all the cities of 
Israel till the Son of man come. The 
disciple is not above the master, nor 
the servant above his lord. It is enough
for the disciple that he be as his 
master, and the servant as his lord. If 
they have called the good man of the 
house Beelzebub, how much more 
them of his household? Therefore fear
them not; for nothing is covered that 
shall not be revealed; nor hid that shall
not be known. That which I tell you in 
the dark, speak ye in the light; and that
which you hear in the ear, preach ye 
upon the housetops. And fear ye not 
them that kill the body, and are not 
able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him 
that can cast both soul and body into 
hell.
