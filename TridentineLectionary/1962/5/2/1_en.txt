Graciously hear our Prayers, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, which we bring 
before Thee on the solemnity of 
blessed Athanasius, Thy confessor and
pontiff, and, by the merits and 
intercession of him who had the grace 
to serve Thee worthily, absolve us of 
all our sins. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
