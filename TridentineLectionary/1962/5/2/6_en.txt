May the annual solemnity of Saint 
Athanasius, Thy confessor, commend 
us to Thy loving kindness, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, that, by this office of 
pious atonement, a blessed reward 
may follow him, and he may obtain for 
us the gifts of Thy grace. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
