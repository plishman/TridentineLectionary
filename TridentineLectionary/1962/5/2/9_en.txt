O God, the rewarder of faithful souls
grant that, by the prayers of blessed 
Athanasius, Thy confessor and bishop,
whose august festival we celebrate, 
we may obtain pardon. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
