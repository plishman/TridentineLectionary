O God, Who hast consecrated this day 
to the triumph of blessed Venantius, 
Thy martyr, harken to the prayers of 
Thy people, and grant that we, who 
venerate his merits, may imitate the 
constancy of his faith. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
