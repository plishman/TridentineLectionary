May the merits of blessed Venantius 
render this oblation acceptable to Thee,
O almighty God, that, being assisted 
by his help, we may be made sharers 
of his glory. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(During Eastertide)
