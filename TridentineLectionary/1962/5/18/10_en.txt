We have partaken, O Lord, of the 
sacrament of eternal life, humbly 
beseeching Thee, that by the prayer of 
blessed Venantius in our behalf it may 
gain for us pardon and grace. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
