St. Augustine was a Roman monk, and was sent by Pope Gregory the Great
with forty companions to England in order to convert that land to the Faith. The 
result far surpassed the expectations of the Pope, for God set his seal on the 
preaching of St. Augustine by so great a number of miracles that the age of the 
apostles seemed to have come again. Ethelbert, the King of Kent, together with 
the chief persons of his court, was the first to receive Baptism from the hands of 
the saint, who gave bodily health to the sick as well as salvation to their souls.
By command of St. Gregory, Augustine was consecrated the first Bishop of the 
English by Virgilius of ArIes. Returning to England, he consecrated bishops for 
other Sees and established his own See, as Primate, at Canterbury, where he 
also built a monastery. He died on May 26, 609, and was at once venerated as 
a saint. This feast was placed on the Calender by Leo XIII.
