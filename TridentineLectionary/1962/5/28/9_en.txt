Refreshed with the victim of salvation, 
we supplicate Thee, O Lord, that, 
through the intercessory patronage of 
blessed Augustine, it may always and 
everywhere be offered to Thy name. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
