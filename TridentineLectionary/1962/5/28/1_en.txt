O God, Who didst vouchsafe to illumine
the English people with the light of the 
true faith by the preaching and miracles
of blessed Augustine, Thy confessor 
and bishop, grant that, by his 
intercession, the hearts of those who 
err may return to the unity of the truth 
and that we may be of one mind in Thy 
will. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
