Brethren, we had confidence in our 
God to speak unto you the gospel of 
God in much carefulness. For our 
exhortation was not of error, nor of 
uncleanness, nor in deceit. But as we 
were approved by God that the gospel 
should be committed to us: even so we 
speak, not as pleasing men, but God, 
Who proveth our hearts. For neither 
have we used at any time the speech 
of flattery, as you know; nor taken an 
occasion of covetousness, God is 
witness: nor sought we glory of men, 
neither of you, nor of others. Whereas 
we might have been burdensome to 
you, as the apostles of Christ: but we 
became little ones in the midst of you, 
as if a nurse should cherish her 
children: so desirous of you, we would 
gladly impart unto you not only the 
gospel of God, but also our own souls; 
because you were become most dear 
unto us. For, you remember, brethren, 
our labor and toil: working night and 
day lest we should be chargeable to 
any of you, we preached unto you the 
gospel of God.
