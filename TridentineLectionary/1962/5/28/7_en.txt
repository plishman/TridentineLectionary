We offer sacrifice unto Thee, O Lord, 
on the solemnity of blessed Augustine, 
Thy bishop and confessor, humbly 
beseeching that the sheep which have 
gone astray may return to the one fold 
and be nourished with this food of 
salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
