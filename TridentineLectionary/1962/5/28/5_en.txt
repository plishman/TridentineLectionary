At that time, the Lord appointed 
seventy-two others, and sent them forth
two by two before Him into every town 
and place where He Himself was about
to come. And He said to them, The 
harvest indeed is great, but the 
laborers are few. Pray therefore the 
Lord of the harvest to send forth 
laborers into His harvest. Go. Behold, I 
send you forth as lambs in the midst of 
wolves. Carry neither purse, nor wallet, 
nor sandals, and greet no one on the 
way. Whatever house you enter, first 
say, ‘Peace to this house!’ And if a son 
of peace be there, your peace will rest 
upon him; but if not, it will return to you.
And remain in the same house, eating 
and drinking what they have; for the 
laborer deserves his wages. Do not go 
from house to house. And whatever 
town you enter, and they receive you, 
eat what is set before you, and cure the
sick who are there, and say to them, 
‘The kingdom of God is at hand for 
you.’
