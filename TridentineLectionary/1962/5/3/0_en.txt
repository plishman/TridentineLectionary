Let Thy Saints bless Thee, O Lord; 
they shall speak of the glory of Thy 
Kingdom, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 144: 1) I
will extol thee, O God my King: and I 
will bless Thy name for ever: yea, for 
ever and ever. Glory be to the Father, 
and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now, and 
ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen. Let Thy Saints bless Thee, O 
Lord; they shall speak of the glory of 
Thy Kingdom, alleluia, alleluia.
