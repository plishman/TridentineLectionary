Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that we who commemorate the 
anniversary of the death of Thy saints, 
Alexander, Eventius, Theodulus and 
Juvenal, may by their intercession be 
freed from all the evils that threaten us. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
