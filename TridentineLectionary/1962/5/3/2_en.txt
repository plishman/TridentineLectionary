Blessed be the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Who according to 
His great mercy hath regenerated us 
unto a lively hope, by the resurrection 
of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an 
inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
and that cannot fade, reserved in 
heaven for you, who, by the power of 
God, are kept by faith unto salvation, 
ready to be revealed in the last time. 
Wherein you shall greatly rejoice if now
you must be for a little time made 
sorrowful in divers temptations: that the
trial of your faith much more precious 
than gold (which is tried by the fire) 
may be found unto praise and glory 
and honor, at the appearing of Jesus 
Christ our Lord.
