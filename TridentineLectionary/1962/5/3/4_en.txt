At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
I am the vine, you the branches: he that
abideth in Me, and I in him, the same 
beareth much fruit: for without Me you 
can do nothing. If any one abide not in 
Me, he shall be cast forth as a branch 
and shall wither, and they shall gather 
him up and cast him into the fire: and 
he burneth. If you abide in Me and My 
words abide in you, you shall ask 
whatever you will, and it shall be done 
unto you. In this is My Father glorified, 
that you bring forth very much fruit and 
become My disciples. As the Father 
hath loved Me, I also have loved you. 
Abide in My love. If you keep My 
commandments, you shall abide in My 
love: as I also have kept My Fatherâ€™s 
commandments, and do abide in His 
love. These things I have spoken to 
you, that My joy may be in you, and 
your joy may be filled.
