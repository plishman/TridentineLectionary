Receive, O Lord, the prayers of Thy 
May a bountiful blessing, O Lord, 
descend upon these offerings and, 
through Thy mercy, may it help to make
us holy and to be joyful on the feast of 
the saints. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
