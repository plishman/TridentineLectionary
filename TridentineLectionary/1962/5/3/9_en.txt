With our strength renewed from having 
shared in Thy sacred gifts, we beseech
You, O Lord our God, that by the 
intercession of Thy saints Alexander, 
Eventius, Theodulus, and Juvenal we 
may feel the effect of the worship we 
are offering. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
