Filled with heavenly food, and 
refreshed with the spiritual cup, we 
beseech Thee, O almighty God, that 
Thou defend us from the. malice of the 
enemy, as Thou hast bidden us triumph
by the wood of the holy cross, the 
armor of justice for the salvation of the 
world. Through the same Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.

<i>(During Eastertide, the following 
commemoration is made.)</i>
<br>
Refreshed by partaking of Thy sacred 
gift, we pray, Thee, O Lord, our God, 
that by the intercessions of Thy saints 
Alexander, Eventius, Theodulus, and 
Juvenal, we may experience the effect 
of that to which we pay our worship. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
