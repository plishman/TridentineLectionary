O God, for Whose honor Stanislaus, 
the glorious bishop, fell by the sword of 
the impious, grant, we beseech Thee, 
that all who implore his aid may obtain 
the salutary effect of their petition. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
