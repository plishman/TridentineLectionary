St. Stanislaus, a Polish martyr, was Bishop of Cracow. King Boleslaw II was
outraging the whole kingdom by his acts of lust and cruelty. St. Stanislaus, 
finding all remonstrances useless, excommunicated him. By order of the king he
was cut in pieces at the foot of the altar while celebrating High Mass on the 
feast of the Apparition of St. Michael in the oratory of the Holy Archangel on the 
outskirts of Cracow. Because, however, that day had been dedicated from the 
early Middle Ages to the Archangel, when the feast of the martyred bishop was 
introduced into the Calendar of the Universal Church by Clement VIII, it was
kept in anticipation, that is, on the eve of his death.
