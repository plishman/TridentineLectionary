Come thou, spouse of Christ, receive 
the crown which the Lord hath 
prepared for thee from everlasting: for 
those who love thou didst shed thy 
blood. Thou hast loved justice and 
hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, 
hath anointed thee with the oil of 
gladness above thy fellows. With thy
comeliness and thy beauty set out, 
proceed prosperously, and reign.
