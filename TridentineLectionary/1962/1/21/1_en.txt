O Almighty and everlasting God, who
dost choose the weak things of the 
world to confound the strong: 
mercifully grant that we who keep the 
solemn feast of blessed Agnes, Thy 
Virgin and Martyr, may experience the 
benefit of her pleading with Thee. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
