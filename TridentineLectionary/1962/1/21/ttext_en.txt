Of all the virgin martyrs of Rome, none was held in such high honour by the 
primitive church as St. Agnes, who, according to Pope Damasus, declared 
herself a Christian as soon as the imperial edict against Christians was 
promulgated. A Roman maiden in her thirteenth year, she was beheaded, in the
year 304, for the sole reason that she was a Christian. The original Mass for her
feast in the Gregorian Sacramentary had a magnificent Preface that is not 
inserted in modern Missals. She is praised by all the Fathers of the Latin 
Church; the family of Constantine built a magnificent basilica at her tomb.
