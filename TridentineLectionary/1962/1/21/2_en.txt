I will give glory to Thee, O Lord, O 
King, and I will praise Thee, O God my 
Savior. I will give glory to Thy name: for
Thou hast been a helper and protector 
to me, and hast preserved my body 
from destruction, from the snare of an 
unjust tongue, and from the lips of them
that forge lies: and in the sight of them 
that stood by Thou hast been my 
helper. And Thou has delivered me, 
according to the multitude of the mercy
of Thy name, from them that did roar 
prepared to devour; out of the hands of
them that sought my life, and from the 
gates of afflictions which compassed 
me about: from the oppression of the 
flame which surrounded me, and in the
midst of the fire I was not burnt: from 
the depth of the belly of hell, and from 
an unclean tongue, and from lying 
words, from an unjust king, and from a 
slanderous tongue. My soul shall 
praise the Lord even to death: 
because Thou, O Lord our God, 
deliverest them that wait for Thee, and 
savest the out of the hands of the 
nations.
