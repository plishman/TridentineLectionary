Behold the Lord the Ruler is come: and
the Kingdom is in His Hand, and 
power, and dominion. (Ps. 71: 2) Give 
to the king Thy judgment, O God: and 
to the king's Son Thy justice. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Behold the 
Lord the Ruler is come: and the 
Kingdom is in His Hand, and power, 
and dominion.
