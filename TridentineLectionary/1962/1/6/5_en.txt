When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of 
Juda in the days of king Herod, behold 
there came wise men from the East to 
Jerusalem, saying: Where is He that is 
born king of the Jews? For we have 
seen His star in the East, and are 
come to adore Him. And king Herod 
hearing this was troubled, and all 
Jerusalem with him. And assembling 
together all the chief priests and the 
scribes of the people, he inquired of 
them where Christ should be born. But 
they said to him: In Bethlehem of Juda.
For so it is written by the Prophet. And 
thou Bethlehem, the land of Juda, are 
not the least among the princes of 
Juda: for out of thee shall come forth 
the Captain that shall rule My people 
Israel. Then Herod, privately calling the
wise men, learned diligently of them 
the time of the star which appeared to 
them: and sending them into 
Bethlehem, said: Go and diligently 
inquire after the Child, and when you 
have found Him, bring me word again, 
that I also may come and adore Him. 
Who having heard the king went their 
way. And behold the star, which they 
had seen in the East, went before them
until it came and stood over where the 
Child was. And seeing the star they 
rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And 
entering into the house, they found the 
Child with Mary His Mother, (Here 
genuflect) and falling down they adored
Him. And opening their treasures, they 
offered Him gifts, gold, frankincense, 
and myrrh. And having received an 
answer in sleep that they should not 
return to Herod, they went back 
another way into their country.
