Arise, be enlightened, O Jerusalem: for
thy light is come, and the glory of the 
Lord is risen upon thee. For behold 
darkness shall cover the earth, and a 
mist the people: but the Lord shall arise
upon thee, and His glory shall be seen 
upon thee. And the Gentiles shall walk 
in thy light, and kings in the brightness 
of thy rising. Lift up thy eyes round 
about and see: all these are gathered 
together: they are come to thee: thy 
sons shall come from afar, and thy 
daughters shall rise up at thy side. 
Then shalt thou see and abound, and 
thy heart shall wonder and be 
enlarged, when the multitude of the 
sea shall be converted to thee, the 
strength of the Gentiles shall come to 
thee. The multitude of camels shall 
cover thee, the dromedaries of Madian 
and Epha: all they from Saba shall 
come, bringing gold and frankincense 
and showing forth their praise to the 
Lord.
