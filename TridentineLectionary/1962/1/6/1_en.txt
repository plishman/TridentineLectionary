O God, who on this day, didst manifest 
Thine only-begotten Son to the 
Gentiles by the guidance of a star: 
graciously grant, that we, who know 
Thee now by faith, may be led on even 
to contemplate the beauty of Thy 
Majesty. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
