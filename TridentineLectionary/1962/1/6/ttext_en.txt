(Station at St. Peter's)
Epiphany means "appearance" or "manifestation," and among the Eastern 
Christians had originally the same significance as Christmas in Rome. It was the
festival of the eternal Word, clothed in the flesh, revealing Himself to mankind. 
Three different phases of this historical manifestation were especially venerated-
viz., the adoration of the Magi at Bethlehem, 'the changing of the water into wine
at Cana, and the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan. The station at St. Peter's is 
inspired by the same thought as that of Christmas Day. In Rome the greater 
festivals are celebrated at the Pastor Ecclesire whose basilica is the sheepfold 
of the Roman flock.
The interior life of a Christian is the reproduction of the life of Jesus; thus the 
object of the Church in placing before us the annual cycle of feasts is not merely
to commemorate the great historical epochs in the history of our redemption, 
but also to reproduce in our souls their spiritual teaching. Hence in the Night 
Office of this feast of the Epiphany we do not so much adore the Christ who 
showed Himself twenty centuries ago to the Magi, but rather the Christ who has 
revealed Himself to us, too, who are now living.
