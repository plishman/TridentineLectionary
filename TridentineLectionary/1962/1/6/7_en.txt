Look graciously, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, upon the offering of Thy Church, 
in which gold, frankincense, and myrrh 
are no longer offered: but He, who by 
these same gifts was signified, is 
sacrificed and received, even Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
