(For St. Agnes Virgin and Martyr)
O God, who year by year dost gladden 
us with the festival of blessed Agnes, 
Thy Virgin and Martyr, grant, we 
beseech Thee, that as we honor her in 
this service, we may follow the 
example of her holy life. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
