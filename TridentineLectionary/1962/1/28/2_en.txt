O God, Who after the example of Thine
own love didst divinely teach blessed 
Peter to enrich Thy Church with a new 
offspring for the ransoming of the 
faithful: grant by his intercession that 
we may be set free from the bondage 
of sin, and may rejoice
in lasting freedom in our heavenly 
home. Who lives and reigns with God 
the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
