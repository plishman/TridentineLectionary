For St. Emerentiana
May blessed Emerentiana, Thy Virgin 
and Martyr, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
obtain pardon for us: both by her 
chastity and by her confession of Thy 
power, she was ever pleasing to Thee. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
