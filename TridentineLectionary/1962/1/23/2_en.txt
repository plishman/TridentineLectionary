O God, Who didst elect blessed 
Raymond to be an eminent minister of 
the sacrament of penance, and didst 
miraculously guide him through the 
waves of the sea, grant that by his 
intercession, we may bring forth worthy
fruits of penance, and reach the haven 
of eternal life. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
