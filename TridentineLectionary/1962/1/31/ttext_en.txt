St. John was born Aug. 16, 1815, at Becchi, Italy. His life work was that of taking
care of young boys and girls. For this purpose he founded the Congregation
of the Salesian Fathers in 1852 and the Daughters of Our Lady Help of 
Christians in 1872. Such was his zeal for the welfare of young people that today 
there are over 1,400 of his institutions spread over the earth. He died in 1888 
and was canonized by Pope Pius XI, Easter Sunday, 1934.
