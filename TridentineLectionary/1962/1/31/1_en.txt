O God, who hath raised up in thy 
Confessor Saint John a father and 
teacher of youth, and didst will that 
through him with the help of the Virgin 
Mary new religious families should 
flourish in the Church, grant, we 
beseech Thee, that enkindled by the 
same fire of charity we may be able to 
labor in finding souls and serve only 
Thee. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
