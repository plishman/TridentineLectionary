And God gave to him wisdom and 
understanding exceeding much; and 
largeness of heart as the sand that is 
on the seashore. (Ps. 112: 1) Praise 
the Lord, ye children: praise ye the 
name of the Lord. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. And God gave to him 
wisdom and understanding exceeding 
much; and largeness of heart as the 
sand that is on the seashore.
