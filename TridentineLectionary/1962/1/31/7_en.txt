Take, O Lord, this clean offering of the 
Victim of salvation, and assure us that
loving Thee in all and above all, we 
may earn the reward of life in the 
praise of Thy glory. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
