Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say,
rejoice. Let your modesty be known to 
all men. The Lord is nigh. Be in 
nothing solicitous; but in everything, by 
prayer and supplication, with 
thanksgiving, let your petitions be 
made known to God. And the peace of 
God, which surpasseth all 
understanding, keep your hearts and 
minds in Christ Jesus. For the rest, 
brethren, whatsoever things are true, 
whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, 
whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, 
whatsoever of good fame, if there be 
any virtue, if any praise of discipline, 
think on these things. The things which 
you have both learned, and received, 
and heard, and seen in me, these do 
ye, and the God of peace shall be with 
you.
