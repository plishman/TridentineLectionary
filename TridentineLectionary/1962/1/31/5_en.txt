At that time, the disciples came to 
Jesus, saying: Who thinkest Thou is 
the greater in the kingdom of heaven? 
And Jesus, calling unto Him a little 
child, set him in the midst of them, and 
said: Amen, I say to you, unless you 
be converted,and become as little 
children, you shall not enter into the 
kingdom of heaven. Whosoever 
therefore shall humble himself as this 
little child, he is the greater in the 
kingdom of heaven. And he that shall 
receive one such little child in My 
name, receiveth Me.
