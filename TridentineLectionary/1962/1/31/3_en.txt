Trust in the Lord, and do good, and 
dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed 
with its riches. Delight in the Lord and 
He will give thee the requests of thy 
heart: Commit thy way to the Lord, and 
trust in Him, and he will do it.
Alleluia, alleluia. The poor and needy 
shall praise thy name. Alleluia.
