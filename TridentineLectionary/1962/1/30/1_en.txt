O God, who among the other marvels 
of Thy power, hast granted even to the 
weaker sex the victory of martyrdom: 
mercifully grant: that we who celebrate 
the heavenly birthday of blessed 
Martina, Thy Virgin and Martyr, may, by
her example draw nearer to Thee. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
