I spoke of Thy testimonies before 
kings, and I was not ashamed: I 
meditated also on Thy commandments,
which I loved. (Ps. 118: 1) Blessed are
the undefiled in the way: who walk in 
the law of the Lord. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. I spoke of Thy testimonies 
before kings, and I was not ashamed: I 
meditated also on Thy commandments,
which I loved.
