Alleluia, alleluia. After her shall virgins
be brought to the King: her neighbors 
shall be brought to Thee with gladness.
Alleluia.
Come thou, spouse of Christ, receive 
the crown which the Lord hath 
prepared for thee from everlasting: for 
those who love thou didst shed thy 
blood. (Ps. 44: 8, 5) Thou hast loved 
justice and hated iniquity: therefore 
God, thy God, hath anointed thee with 
the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 
With thy comeliness and thy beauty set
out, proceed prosperously, and reign.
