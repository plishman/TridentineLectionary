At that time, Jesus spoke to His 
disciples this parable: The Kingdom of 
Heaven shall be like to ten virgins, who
taking their lamps went out to meet the 
bridegroom and the bride. And five of 
them were foolish, and five wise. But 
the five foolish, having taken their 
lamps, did not take oil with them: but 
the wise took oil in their vessels with 
the lamps. And the bridegroom tarrying,
they all slumbered and slept. And at 
midnight there was a cry made: Behold
the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to 
meet him. Then all those virgins arose 
and trimmed their lamps. And the 
foolish said to the wise: Give us of your
oil, for our lamps are gone out. The 
wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps 
there be not enough for us and for you,
go ye rather to them that sell, and buy 
for yourselves. Now whilst they went to 
buy, the bridegroom came: and they 
that were ready, went in with him to the
marriage, and the door was shut. But at
last come also the other virgins, saying:
Lord, Lord, open to us. But he 
answering said: Amen I say to you, I 
know you not. Watch ye therefore, 
because you know not the day nor the 
hour.
