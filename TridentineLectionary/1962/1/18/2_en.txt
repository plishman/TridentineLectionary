O Lord my God, Thou hast exalted my
dwelling place upon the earth, and I 
have prayed for death to pass away. I 
called upon the Lord, the Father of my 
Lord, that He would not leave me in the
day of my trouble, and in the time of 
the proud without help. I will praise Thy
Name continually, and will praise it with
thanksgiving, and my prayer was 
heard. And Thou hast saved me from 
destruction, and hast delivered me 
from the evil time. Therefore I will give 
thanks and praise to Thee, O Lord our 
God.
