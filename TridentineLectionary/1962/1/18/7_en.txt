May this sacrifice, we beseech Thee, O
Lord, which we offer to commemorate 
the birthday of Thy saints, both loose 
the bonds of our base nature and bring
upon us the gifts of Thy mercy. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
