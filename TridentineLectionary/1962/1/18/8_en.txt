I have done judgment and justice, O
Lord, give me not up to them that 
slander me: I was directed to all Thy 
commandments, I have hated all 
wicked ways.
We beseech Thee, O Lord, that, being 
filled with the mysteries of salvation, 
we may be helped by her prayers 
whose feast we celebrate. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
