Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we, who venerate the 
birthday of blessed Prisca, Thy virgin 
and martyr, may both rejoice for her 
annual solemnity and profit by the 
example of such faith. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
