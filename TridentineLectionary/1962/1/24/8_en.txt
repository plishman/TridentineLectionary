Graciously receive, O Lord, the Sacred 
Victim we, by the merits of Blessed 
Timothy, Thy martyr and bishop, 
dedicate to Thee; and grant that it may 
be to us an everlasting help. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
