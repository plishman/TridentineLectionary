Have regard to our weakness, O 
almighty God: and grant that we who 
are borne down by the weight of our 
own evil deeds may be safeguarded by
the glorious intercession of Blessed 
Timothy, thy Martyr and Bishop. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
