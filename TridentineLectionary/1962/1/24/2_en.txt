Dearly beloved, Follow after justice, 
godliness, faith, charity, patience, 
mildness. Fight the good fight of faith; 
lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou 
art called, and hast confessed a good 
confession before many witnesses. I 
charge thee before God, Who 
quickeneth all things, and before Christ
Jesus, Who gave testimony under 
Pontius Pilate, a good confession; that
thou keep the commandment without 
spot, blameless, unto the coming of 
Our Lord Jesus Christ; which, in His 
times, He shall show, Who is the 
blessed and only mighty, the King of 
kings, and Lord of lords; Who alone 
hath immortality, and inhabiteth light 
inaccessible; Whom no man hath seen
nor can see; to Whom be honor and 
empire everlasting. Amen.
