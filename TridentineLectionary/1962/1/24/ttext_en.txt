St. Timothy was a convert of St. Paul who believed that he was intended for an
evangelist. Timothy was ordained and at once became the beloved fellow-
worker of St. Paul. Finally, he became the first bishop of Ephesus, and while 
there received the two Epistles which bear his name. In the year 97 he was 
beaten and stoned to death because of his opposition to idolatrous ceremonies.
