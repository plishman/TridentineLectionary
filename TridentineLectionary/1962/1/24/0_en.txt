The Lord made to him a covenant of 
peace, and made him a prince; that the
dignity of priesthood should be to him 
forever. (Ps. 131: 1). O Lord, 
remember David: and all his 
meekness. Glory be to the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. The 
Lord made to him a covenant of peace,
and made him a prince; that the dignity 
of priesthood should be to him forever.
