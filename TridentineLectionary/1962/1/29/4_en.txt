Alleluia, alleluia. The Lord loved him 
and adorned him: He clothed him with 
a robe of glory. Alleluia.
Blessed is the man that feareth the 
Lord: he shall delight exceedingly in 
His commandments. His seed shall be
mighty upon earth: the generation of 
the righteous shall be blessed. Glory 
and wealth shall be in his house: and 
his justice remaineth forever and ever.
