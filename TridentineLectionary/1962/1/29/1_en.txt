O God, Who for the salvation of souls 
willed that blessed Francis, Thy 
Confessor and Bishop, should become 
all things to all men, mercifully grant 
that we, filled by the sweetness of Thy 
love, guided by his teachings, and 
aided by his merits, may attain the joys 
of everlasting life. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
