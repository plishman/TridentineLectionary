Mercifully hear, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, the prayers of Thy people; that 
we who rejoice in the martyrdom of 
blessed Marcellus, Thy Martyr and 
Bishop, may be helped by his merits. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
