Marcellus did not die a violent death and was formerly venerated at Rome as a 
Confessor in the original meaning of the word. Because of his mildness in 
reconciling sinners by the Sacrament of Penance the austere heretical party 
raised a tumult. The tyrant Maxentius then condemned Marcellus to exile, from 
the trials of which, he subsequently died. He may thus be rightly called a martyr 
because of his sufferings.
