At that time, Jesus said to His 
disciples: Nothing is covered that shall 
not be revealed; nor hid, that shall not 
be known. That which I tell you in the 
dark, speak ye in the light; and that 
which you hear in the ear, preach ye 
upon the housetops. And fear ye not 
them that kill the body, and are not able
to kill the soul; but rather fear him that 
can destroy both soul and body in hell. 
Are not two sparrows sold for a 
farthing, and not one of them shall fall 
on the ground without your Father; but 
the very hairs of your head are all 
numbered. Fear not, therefore; better 
are you than many sparrows. Every 
one therefore that shall confess Me 
before men, I will also confess him 
before My Father who is in heaven.
