O God, who dost gladden us by the 
annual feast of blessed Polycarp, Thy 
Martyr and Bishop: mercifully grant that
we who celebrate his heavenly 
birthday, may also rejoice in his 
protection. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
