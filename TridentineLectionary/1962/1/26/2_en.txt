Most dearly beloved: Whosoever is not 
just, is not of God, nor he that loveth 
not his brother. For this is the 
declaration, which you have heard from
the beginning, that you should love one
another. Not as Cain, who was of the 
wicked one, and killed his brother. And 
wherefore did he kill him? Because his 
own works were wicked: and his 
brother's just. Wonder not, brethren, if 
the world hate you. We know that we 
have passed from death to life, 
because we love the brethren. He that 
loveth not, abideth in death. 
Whosoever hateth his brother is a 
murderer. And you know that no 
murderer hath eternal life abiding in 
himself. In this we have known the 
charity of God, because he hath laid 
down his life for us: and we ought to lay
down our lives for the brethren.
