Represented by participation in the 
sacred gift, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
our God, that, through the intercession 
of blessed Polycarp, Thy martyr and 
bishop, we may ever experience the 
effect of the worship we offer. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
