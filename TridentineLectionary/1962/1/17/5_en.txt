At that time, Peter said to Jesus: 
Behold we have left all things, and 
have followed thee: what therefore 
shall we have? And Jesus said to 
them: Amen, I say to you, that you, who
have followed me, in the regeneration 
when the Son of man shall sit on the 
seat of his majesty, you also shall sit on
twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes 
of Israel. And every one that hath left 
house, or brethren, or sisters, or father,
or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
for My Name's sake, shall receive an 
hundredfold, and shall possess life 
everlasting.
