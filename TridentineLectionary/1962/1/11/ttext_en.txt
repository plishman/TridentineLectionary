St. Iren√¶us, after listing Telesphorus as a martyr, adds the name of Hyginus 
(died 142). His name was placed in the Roman Missal in the late Middle Ages; 
during the first two centuries hardly any of the martyrs had left any trace in the 
Liturgy. Their burial places were generally unknown and their worship was local;
there was danger that Catholic devotion to the saints might be regarded as a 
new form of paganism.
