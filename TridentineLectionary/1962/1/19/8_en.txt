O Lord, having regard to the prayers 
and offerings of Thy faithful people: 
that they may be pleasing to Thee on 
the feast day of Thy Saints, and obtain 
for us Thine indulgent aid. Through the
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
For St. Canute
May our offering be acceptable in Thy 
sight, O Lord, and may it benefit us by 
the prayer of him on whose feast it is 
offered. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
