Give ear, O Lord, to Thy people when 
with Thy Saints as advocates we 
humbly pray: that Thou wouldst grant 
us in our present life joy and peace and
growth of life eternal. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
For St. Canute
O God, Who, for the greater glory of 
Thy Church, wast pleased to adorn 
blessed Canute the king with the palm 
of martyrdom and with glorious 
miracles: mercifully grant that walking 
in the footsteps of him who followed 
our Lord in His sufferings, we may 
deserve to attain eternal joys. Through
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
