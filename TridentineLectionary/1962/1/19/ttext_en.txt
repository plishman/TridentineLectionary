This group of Persian martyrs, consisted of a husband, wife, and two sons. The 
men were beheaded and their bodies burnt. Martha was killed and her body 
thrown into a well. They came to Rome under the Emperor Claudius II and 
visited Christians cast into prison, and buried the slain. The Mass for their feast 
is very ancient and in excellent liturgical form.
