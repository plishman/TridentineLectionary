Brethren, call to mind the former days, 
wherein, being illuminated, you 
endured a great fight of afflictions. And 
on the one hand indeed, by reproaches
and tribulations, were made a 
gazingstock; and on the other, became 
companions of them that were used in 
such sort. For you both had 
compassion on them that were in 
bands, and took with joy the being 
stripped of your own goods, knowing 
that you have a better and a lasting 
substance. Do not therefore lose your 
confidence, which hath a great reward. 
For patience is necessary for you; that,
doing the will of God, you may receive 
the promise. For yet a little and a very 
little while, and he that is to come, will 
come, and will not delay. But my just 
man liveth by faith; but if he withdraw 
himself, he shall not please my soul.
