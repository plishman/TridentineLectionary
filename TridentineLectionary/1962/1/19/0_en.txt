Let the just feast and rejoice before 
God, and be delighted with gladness. 
(Ps) Let God arise, and let HIs 
enemies be scattered: and let them 
that hate Him flee from before His face.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Let the just 
feast and rejoice before God, and be 
delighted with gladness.
