Be appeased, O Lord, by the 
intercession of Thy Saints and grant, 
we beseech Thee, that we may retain 
the fruits of this present Sacrifice unto 
eternal salvation. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
For St. Canute
Refreshed by partaking of Thy sacred 
Gift, we beseech thee, O Lord, our 
God, that through the intercession of 
blessed Canute, Thy Martyr, we may 
perceive the fruit of the rite which we 
celebrate. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
