God, Who hast taught the whole world 
by the preaching of blessed Paul, Thy 
apostle, we beseech Thee, grant us, 
who this day celebrate his conversion, 
that we may advance toward Thee by 
following his example.
For Saint Peter
God, Who, committing to blessed 
Peter, Thine apostle, the keys of the 
heavenly kingdom, didst bestow on him
the pontifical function of binding and 
loosing, grant that, by the help of his 
intercession, we may be delivered from
the bonds of our sins. Who lives and 
reigns with God the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
