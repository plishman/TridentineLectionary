I know whom I have believed and I am 
certain that he is able to keep that 
which I have committed to him, against
that day; being a just judge. (Ps. 138: 
1-2) Lord, Thou hast proved me and 
known me: Thou hast known my sitting 
down, and my rising up. v. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. I know whom I have 
believed and I am certain that he is 
able to keep that which I have 
committed to him, against that day; 
being a just judge.
