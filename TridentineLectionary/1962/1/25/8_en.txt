Through the prayer of Paul, Thy 
apostle, sanctify, O Lord, the offerings 
of Thy people, that what is pleasing to 
Thee by Thine own ordinance, may 
become more pleasing by the favor of 
his supplication. 
For Saint Peter
We beseech Thee, O Lord, that the 
prayer of the blessed apostle Peter 
may commend the sacrifices and 
supplications of Thy Church, so that 
the celebration we hold for his glory 
may profit for our pardon. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
