At that time, Peter said to Jesus, 
Behold we have left all things and have
followed Thee: what therefore shall we 
have? And Jesus said to them, Amen I 
say to you, that you who have followed 
Me, in the regeneration, when the Son 
of man shall sit on the seat of his 
majesty, you also shall sit on twelve 
seats judging the twelve tribes of 
Israel. And every one that hath left 
house, or brethren, or sisters, or father,
or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
for My name's sake, shall receive a 
hundredfold, and shall possess life 
everlasting.
