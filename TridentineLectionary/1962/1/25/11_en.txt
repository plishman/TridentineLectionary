Sanctified by this saving mystery, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, that he, under 
whose patronage Thou hast 
vouchsafed to place us, may not fail to 
intercede for us. 
For Saint Peter
Let us pray. Let the gift we offer bring 
us joy, O Lord, that, as we declare 
Thee wonderful in Thine apostle Peter, 
so through him we may share the 
generosity of Thy forgiveness. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
