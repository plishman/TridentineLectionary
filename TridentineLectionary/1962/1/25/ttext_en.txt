(Station at St. Paul) Since the eighth century the feast of the conversion of St. 
Paul has been set apart by the Church to return thanks to almighty God for His 
act of grace in bringing the future apostle to the Faith. At one time the feast was
even a holy-day of obligation. After the miracle of Christ's Resurrection, no
other wonder in the history of the early Church is a stronger proof of the divine 
origin of Christianity than the marvelous conversion of St. Paul.
