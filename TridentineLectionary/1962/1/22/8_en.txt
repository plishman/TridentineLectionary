We beseech Thee, almighty God, that 
we who have eaten heavenly food may
through it be protected from all 
adversities by the intercession of Thy 
blessed Martyrs Vincent and 
Anastasius. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
