Alleluia, alleluia. The bodies of the 
Saints are buried in peace, and their 
name liveth unto generation and 
generation. Alleluia.
At that time, Jesus said to His 
disciples: When you shall hear of wars 
and seditions, be not terrified: these 
things must first come to pass; but the 
end is not yet presently. Then he said 
to them: Nation shall rise against 
nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 
And there shall be great earthquakes in
divers places, and pestilences, and 
famines, and terrors from heaven; and 
there shall be great signs. But before 
all these things, they will lay their 
hands upon you, and persecute you, 
delivering you up to the synagogues 
and into prisons, dragging you before 
kings and governors, for my name's 
sake. And it shall happen unto you for 
a testimony. Lay it up therefore into 
your hearts, not to meditate before how
you shall answer: For I will give you a 
mouth and wisdom, which all your 
adversaries shall not be able to resist 
and gainsay. And you shall be betrayed
by your parents and brethren, and 
kinsmen and friends; and some of you 
they will put to death. And you shall be 
hated by all men for my name's sake. 
But a hair of your head shall not perish.
In your patience you shall possess 
your souls.
