These two martyrs also had each the honor of a separate stational Mass at
Rome. St. Vincent, a Spanish deacon, suffered death for the Faith, under 
Diocletian, in the year 300. St. Anastasius, a native of Persia, was also put to 
death for being a Christian. The feasts of these two are both celebrated on the 
same day. The example of the heroic fortitude of the martyrs, who in the hope 
of the resurrection, rather than betray the Faith, seek no escape from death, is, 
indeed, necessary in our days when a sentimental pietistic feeling threatens to 
replace in the conscience of many the practical profession of the Christian life.
