O Lord, in memory of Thy saints, we 
offer Thee sacrifices of praise, trusting 
them to deliver us from both present 
and future evils. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
We beseech Thee, O Lord, that, by his 
prayers the holy abbot Maurus may 
obtain that the sacrifices laid upon the 
sacred altars may profit for our 
salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
