In the middle of the Third Century, St. Paul, a native of Egypt, fled into the 
desert, at the age of twenty-two, to escape the persecution that Emperor Decius
waged against Christians. There he devoted his life to penance and prayer. He 
passed nearly a hundred years in solitude, and from the time he was forty-three 
years old his food was brought to him by ravens. The emblem of the Hermits of
St. Paul was a palm-tree; in the Mass of today frequent graceful allusions are 
made to this providential tree which furnished both food and clothing to our 
saint, and which by its spreading branches so truly symbolized in holy Scripture 
the supernatural energy of the just. He died about 341, wrapped in the cloak of 
St. Athanasius lent to him by St. Anthony of the Desert.
(Commemoration of St. Maurus, Abbot) St. Maurus, son of the Roman patrician 
Eutychius and first disciple of St. Benedict, according to the Dialogues of St. 
Gregory the Great, hastening in obedience to help St. Placid, who was 
drowning, walked upon Nero's lake at Subiaco. Died in 584, in France.
