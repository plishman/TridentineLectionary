O God, Who dost gladden us with the 
yearly solemnity of blessed Paul, Thy 
Confessor, mercifully grant that we 
may imitate his actions whose natal 
day we honor. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Let the intercession of the blessed 
abbot Maurus commend us, O Lord, 
we beseech Thee, that we may receive
through his patronage what we could 
not obtain by our own deserts. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
