Filled with heavenly food and drink, we 
humbly pray Thee, our God, that we 
may be helped by the prayers of him in
whose memory we have received Thy 
sacrament. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
May the blessed abbot Maurus, by his 
intercession, together with the 
partaking of the sacrament, protect us, 
O Lord, that we may experience the 
effects of communion with him and 
share his intercessory prayers. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
