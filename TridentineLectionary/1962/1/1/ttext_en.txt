(Station at St. Mary in Trastevere)
The Roman Calendars originally made no mention of the Circumcision, which 
came in through the influence of the Gallican Liturgies. Rome preferred to 
solemnize the eighth day after the Nativity of Our Lord. The Mass and Office for
today's feast show a mixed character. At first it was merely a question of the 
Octave of Our Lord; then, in connection with the Basilica of Our Lady, where the 
station was held, a special commemoration of the virginal motherhood of Mary 
Most Holy was inserted, the Circumcision and Presentation in the Temple being
afterwards added, although this last, doubtless through Byzantine influence, 
was afterwards expunged from the office of January 1, so that it should be 
celebrated on February 2, 40 days from the birth of the infant, in accord with 
Jewish practice.
The Latin of Postcommunion, terse and forcible, yet perfectly balanced and 
rhythmical, implores through the prayers of Mary our purification from sin and 
our attainment of celestial bliss. Jesus in heaven, in the essential brightness of
His glory, is seated at the right hand of the Father, but here below his more 
fitting throne of mercy and grace is in the bosom of the Virgin who holds Him a 
little babe in her arms.
