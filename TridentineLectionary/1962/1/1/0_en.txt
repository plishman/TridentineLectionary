For a Child is born to us, and a Son is 
given to us, and the government is 
upon His shoulder: and His name shall 
be called Wonderful, Counselor. (Ps. 
97: 1) Sing ye to the Lord a new 
canticle: because He hath done 
wonderful things. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. For a Child is born to us, 
and a Son is given to us, and the 
government is upon His shoulder: and 
His name shall be called Wonderful, 
Counselor.
