Dearly beloved: The grace of God our 
Savior hath appeared to all men, 
instructing us, that, denying 
ungodliness and worldly desires, we 
should live soberly and justly and godly
in this world, looking for the blessed 
hope and coming of the glory of the 
great God and our Savior Jesus Christ: 
Who gave Himself for us, that He might
redeem us from all iniquity, and might 
cleanse to Himself a people 
acceptable, a pursuer of good works. 
These things speak
and exhort: in Christ Jesus our Lord.
