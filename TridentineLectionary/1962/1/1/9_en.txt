Communicating, and keeping this most 
holy day, on which the spotless virginity
of blessed Mary brought forth a Savior 
to this world; and also reverencing the 
memory first of the same glorious Mary,
ever Virgin, Mother of the same our 
God and Lord Jesus Christ: as also of 
the blessed Apostles and Martyrs Peter
and Paul, Andrew, James, John, 
Thomas, James, Philip, Bartholomew, 
Matthew, Simon, and Thaddeus; Linus, 
Cletus, Clement, Xystus, Cornelius, 
Cyprian, Lawrence, Chrysogonus, John
and Paul, Cosmas and Damian, and of 
all Thy Saints, through whose merits 
and prayers, grant that we may in all 
things be defended by the help of Thy 
protection. Through the same Christ 
our Lord. Amen.
