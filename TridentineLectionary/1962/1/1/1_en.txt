O God, Who by the fruitful virginity of 
blessed Mary hast bestowed upon the 
human race the rewards of eternal 
salvation: grant, we beseech Thee, that
we may experience the intercession of 
her, through whom we have been made
worthy to receive the Author of life. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ Thy 
Son. Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
