Besides the chief feast of St. John the Baptist, that of his nativity, the Church
commemorates on the twenty-ninth of August, his glorious death and birth into 
heaven. Ever since the Fourth Century in Africa, in the East, in Syria, and in 
many places all over the world, the beheading of St. John the Baptist has been 
commemorated on August 29th. When in 362, pagans violated the tomb and 
burned his remains, some parts were saved by monks, and taken to St. 
Athanasius at Alexandria. The head is said to have been preserved at 
Jerusalem, and may later have been brought to Rome.
The Gospel of the Mass recounts his martyrdom. He died because his 
sanctity as precursor of Christ was intolerable to the immoral Herodias. He 
anticipated in his death the humiliations of Calvary, but he was rewarded by 
having his praises spoken by the Savior Himself, even if Jesus and his disciples 
did not actually assist at his funeral, as some legends maintain.
Commemoration of St. Sabina, Martyr: St. Sabina, a Roman widow of high birth,
suffered martyrdom under Emperor Hadrian, early in the Second Century, and 
was buried in the same grave with St. Seraphia, her maid-servant, who had 
instructed her in the Faith.
