The offerings which we bring, O Lord, 
in memory of the passion of Thy holy 
martyr, John the Baptist, we pray that, 
by his favor, they may profit us unto 
salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
By the merits of blessed Sabina, Thy 
Martyr, graciously receive, O Lord, the 
offerings consecrated to Thee, and 
grant that they may ever bring us help. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
