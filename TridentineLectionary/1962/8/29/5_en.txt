At that time: Herod sent and 
apprehended John, and bound him in 
prison for the sake of Herodias, the 
wife of Philip his brother, because he 
had married her. For John said to 
Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have 
thy brother's wife. Now Herodias laid 
snares for him, and was desirous to put
him to death, and could not. For Herod 
feared John, knowing him to be a just 
and holy man, and kept him, and when 
he heard him did many things; and he 
heard him willingly. And when a 
convenient day was come, Herod made
a supper for his birthday, for the 
princes, and tribunes, and chief men of 
Galilee. And when the daughter of the 
same Herodias had come in, and had 
danced, and pleased Herod, and them 
that were at table with him, the king 
said to the damsel, Ask of me what 
thou wilt, and I will give it thee. And he 
swore to her, whatsoever thou shalt 
ask, I will give thee; though it be the 
half of my kingdom. Who, when she 
was gone out, said to her mother, What
shall I ask? But she said, the head of 
John the Baptist. And when she was 
come in immediately with haste to the 
king,she asked, saying, I will that 
forthwith thou give me in a dish the 
head of John the Baptist. And the king 
was struck sad; yet because of his 
oath, and because of them that were 
with him at table, he would not 
displease her; but sending an 
executioner he commanded that his 
head should be brought in a dish. And 
he beheaded him in the prison, and 
brought his head in a dish, and gave it 
to the damsel, and the damsel gave it 
to her mother. Which his disciples 
hearing, came, and took his body, and 
laid it in a tomb.
