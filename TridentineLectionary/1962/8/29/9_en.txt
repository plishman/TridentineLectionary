May the solemn festival of St. John the 
Baptist bring us the grace, O Lord, both
to venerate that which is signified in the
great sacrament we have received, and
to be joyful because this thing hath 
been more abundantly manifested in 
us. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
Filled with the Gift of Thy divine bounty,
we beseech Thee, O Lord, our God, 
that by the intercession of blessed 
Sabina, Thy Martyr, we may partake 
thereof for evermore. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
