I spoke of Thy testimonies before 
kings, and I was not ashamed: I 
meditated also on Thy commandments,
which I loved exceedingly. (Ps. 91: 2) It 
is good to give praise to the Lord; and 
to sing to Thy name, O Most High. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. I spoke of 
Thy testimonies before kings, and I was
not ashamed: I meditated also on Thy 
commandments, which I loved 
exceedingly.
