In those days: The word of the Lord 
came to me, saying, Gird up thy loins, 
and arise, and speak to Juda all that I 
command thee. Be not afraid at their 
presence; for I will make thee not to 
fear their countenance. For behold I 
have made thee this day a fortified city, 
and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, 
over all the land, to the kings of Juda, 
to the princes thereof, and to the 
priests, and to the people of the land. 
And they shall fight against thee, and 
shall not prevail: for I am with thee, 
saith the Lord, to deliver thee.
