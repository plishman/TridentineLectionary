May the august festival of St. John the 
Baptist, Thy precursor and martyr, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, effect for us the
furtherance of our salvation. Who lives 
and reigns with God the Father in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
O God, who among the other marvels 
of Thy power, hast granted even to the 
weaker sex the victory of martyrdom: 
mercifully grant: that we who celebrate 
the heavenly birthday of blessed 
Sabina, Thy Martyr, may, by her 
example draw nearer to Thee. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
