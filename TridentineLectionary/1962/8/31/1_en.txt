O God, Who didst make blessed 
Raymond, Thy Confessor, wonderful in 
delivering Thy faithful from the captivity 
of the infidels: grant us, by his 
intercession, that being loosed from the
bonds of our sins, we may with free 
minds perform what is pleasing to 
Thee. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
