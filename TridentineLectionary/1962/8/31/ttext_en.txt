The mother of this heroic Spanish saint, did not live for him to know and 
love. He asked the Blessed Virgin to take him: as her special son. She 
revealed to him that he should devote himself to the ransoming of captives. He 
then founded the Order of Our Lady of Mercy for this purpose. He even gave 
himself up as a hostage to the Mohammedans for their sake. He was made a 
Cardinal after his rescue, in 1240, but died shortly after.
