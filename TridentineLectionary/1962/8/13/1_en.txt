The salvation of the just is from the 
Lord: and He is their protector in the 
time of trouble. (Ps. 36: 1) Be not 
emulous of evil-doers: nor envy them 
that work iniquity. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. The salvation of the just is
from the Lord: and He is their protector 
in the time of trouble.
