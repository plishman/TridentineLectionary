From the beginning, and before the 
world, was I created, and unto the 
world to come I shall not cease to be, 
and in the holy dwelling place I have 
ministered before him. And so I was 
established in Sion, and in the holy city 
likewise I rested, and my power was in 
Jerusalem. And I took root in an 
honorable people, and in the portion of 
y God his inheritance, ad my abode is 
in the full assembly of saints.
