Having received, O Lord, these helps to
our salvation, grant, we beseech Thee, 
that we may be ever protected by the 
patronage of blessed Mary ever Virgin, 
in whose honor we have made these 
offerings to Thy majesty. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth 
and reigneth with Thee in the unity of 
the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
