Mercifully receive, O Lord, the 
sacrifices which we offer Thee, and by 
the intercession of blessed Lawrence, 
Thy martyr, loose the bonds of our 
sins. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
We beseech Thee, O Lord, to receive 
our offerings and prayers; and by Thy 
heavenly mysteries cleanse us and 
mercifully hear us. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
