At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
If any man will come after me, let him 
deny himself, and take up his cross, 
and follow me. For he that will save his 
life, shall lose it: and he that shall lose 
his life for my sake, shall find it. For 
what doth it profit a man, if he gain the 
whole world, and suffer the loss of his 
own soul? Or what exchange shall a 
man give for his soul? For the Son of 
man shall come in the glory of his 
Father with his angels: and then will he 
render to every man according to his 
works.
