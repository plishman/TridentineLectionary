Attend, O Lord, to our supplications, 
and by the intercession of Thy blessed 
martyr, Lawrence, whose feast we 
anticipate, graciously bestow upon us 
Thy everlasting mercy. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that by the intercession of 
blessed Romanus, Thy martyr, we 
may be delivered from all adversities in
body, and be purified from all evil 
thoughts in mind. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
