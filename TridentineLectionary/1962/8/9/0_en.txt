He hath distributed, he hath given to 
the poor: his justice remaineth forever
and ever; his horn shall be exalted in 
glory. (Ps. 111: 1) Blessed is the man 
that feareth the Lord; he delighteth 
exceedingly in His commandments. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. He hath 
distributed, he hath given to the poor: 
his justice remaineth forever and ever; 
his horn shall be exalted in glory.
