Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, our 
God, that, as in commemorating 
blessed Lawrence, Thy martyr, we 
show our joy in a temporal duty, so we 
may be gladdened by beholding him in 
eternity. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
We beseech Thee, almighty God, that 
we who have partaken of the food of 
heaven may, by the intercession of 
blessed Romanus, Thy martyr, be 
strengthened by it against all harm. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
