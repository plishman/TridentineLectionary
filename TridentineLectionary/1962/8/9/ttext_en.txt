The vigil of St. Lawrence has been observed in the Church certainly since 
the Fourth Century. The ancient vigils consisted of a fixed number of scriptural 
Lessons alternated with responsorial Psalms and episcopal Collects. When day 
began to break, the Holy Sacrifice was offered and the fast came to an end.
Commemoration of St. Romanus, Martyr: St. Romanus was a Roman
soldier. He was converted to the Christian faith by the preaching of St. 
Lawrence, and was beheaded the day preceding that of the saintâ€™s martyrdom.
