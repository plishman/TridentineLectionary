All the rich among the people shall 
entreat thy countenance: after her shall
virgins be brought to the King: her 
neighbors shall be brought to thee in 
gladness and rejoicing. (Ps. 44: 2) My 
heart hath uttered a good word: I speak
my works to the King. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. All the rich among the 
people shall entreat thy countenance: 
after her shall virgins be brought to the 
King: her neighbors shall be brought to 
thee in gladness and rejoicing.
