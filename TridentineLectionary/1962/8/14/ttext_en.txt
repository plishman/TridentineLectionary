As early as the Seventh Century the preparation, by a solemn fast, for 
keeping devoutly the great festival of the Assumption, is described as a custom 
of great antiquity. In many parts of the Church the strict fast enjoined lasted 
over several days. The Mass celebrated on this day is of Our Blessed Lady, on 
account of its being that of a vigil, and is said in purple vestments, and the hymn
Gloria in excelsis is omitted.
Commemoration of St. Eusebius, Confessor: St. Eusebius was a Roman
priest distinguished for his zeal in the cause of orthodoxy. He lived in the Fourth
Century of our era. He appears to have died in prison. The universal veneration 
in which he was held led to his immediate canonization.
