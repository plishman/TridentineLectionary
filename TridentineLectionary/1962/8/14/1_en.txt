O God, Who didst deign to choose for 
Thy dwelling the virginal womb of the 
blessed Mary, grant, we beseech Thee,
that defended by her protection we may
assist with joy at her festival.
Who lives and reigns with God the 
Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
O God, Who dost gladden us by the 
annual feast of blessed Eusebius, Thy 
confessor, mercifully grant that, as we 
celebrate his natal day, we may also 
imitate his actions. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
