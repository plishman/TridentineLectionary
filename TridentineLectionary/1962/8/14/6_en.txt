May our offerings be commended to 
Thy mercy, O Lord, by the prayer of the
mother of God, Whom Thou hast 
removed from this world that she may 
with confidence intercede for us with 
Thee. Through the same Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
We offer Thee, O Lord, sacrifices of 
praise in commemoration of Thy saints,
by whom we trust to be delivered from 
evils both present and future. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
