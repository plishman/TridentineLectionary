Grant Thine assistance, O merciful 
God, to our frailty, that we, who 
anticipate the festival of God's holy 
mother, may, by the aid of her 
intercession, rise from our iniquity. 
Through the same Lord Jesus Christ, 
Who livest and reignest, with God the 
Father, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, 
one God, forever and ever.
We Thy suppliants, who are refreshed 
with heavenly food and drink, beseech 
Thee, O our God, that we may be 
fortified by the prayers of him in whose 
commemoration we have partaken of 
these gifts. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
