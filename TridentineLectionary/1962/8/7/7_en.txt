Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that our humble offerings may be 
both pleasing to Thee in honor of Thy 
saints and may cleanse us alike in 
body and soul. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Donatus, 
Bishop & Martyr)Grant we beseech Thee, O Lord, that 
through the intercession of Thy holy 
bishop and martyr, Donatus, whom we 
venerate with the offerings dedicated to
the praise of Thy name, the fruit of 
tender devotion may increase in us. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
