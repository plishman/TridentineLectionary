St. Cajetan was born in 1480 in Lombardy, of pious and noble parents. From
childhood he was known as a saint and in later years as "a hunter of souls." 
Even before St. Ignatius he undertook to establish a body of Clerks Regular 
following the apostolic life. Together with Pietro Carafa, afterwards pope Paul IV,
he took the austere vow of entrusting himself entirely to Divine Providence and 
living solely on any alms which might be voluntarily given by the faithful.
Christian Rome venerates him as one of her most distinguished citizens. He
took a notable part in the reform of the Breviary under Clement VII. Worn out 
with toil and sickness he went to his reward in 1547.
Commemoration of St. Donatus, Bishop and Martyr: St. Donatus, Bishop of 
Arezzo in Tuscany, suffered martyrdom under Emperor Julian the Apostate in 
361. He was illustrious for his sanctity and for his gift of working miracles. The 
Church has always remembered him with the highest veneration.
