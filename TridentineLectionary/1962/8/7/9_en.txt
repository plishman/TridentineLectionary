We beseech Thee,O almighty God, that
we, who have partaken of heavenly 
nourishment, may, by the intercession 
of blessed Cajetan, Thy confessor, be 
fortified by it against all adverse 
influences. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Donatus, 
Bishop & Martyr)Almighty and merciful God, Who dost 
make us both the partakers and the 
ministers of Thy sacrament, grant, we 
beseech Thee, that, by the 
intercession of blessed Donatus, Thy 
martyr and bishop, we may profit both 
by our fellowship with him in faith and 
by our worthy service. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
