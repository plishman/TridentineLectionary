O God, Who didst give to Blessed 
Cajetan, Thy confessor, the grace to 
imitate the apostolic way of life, grant 
us by his intercession and example 
ever to trust in Thee and to desire only 
heavenly things. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Donatus, 
Bishop & Martyr)O God, the glory of Thy priests, grant, 
we beseech Thee, that we may 
experience the assistance of Thy holy 
martyr and bishop, Donatus, whose 
festival we celebrate. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
