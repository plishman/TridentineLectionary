St. Philip Benizi was born in Florence on the feast of the Assumption in 
1233. He was one of the first to profess the religious life as a Servite, and in 
time became general of the Order. With his brethren he preached in many 
countries of Europe, and journeyed even into western Asia to spread the 
Christian faith. In his humility he refused honors, and even the Papacy, which 
was offered him by the cardinals assembled in conclave. He entered into the 
glory of heaven in the year 1285. It is said that when he was dying he 
repeatedly asked for his book, and when the infirmarian did not understand his 
meaning the saint made signs that he wanted his crucifix, which was the book in
which he was accustomed to meditate.
