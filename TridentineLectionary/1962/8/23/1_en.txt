O God, Who in blessed Philip, Thy 
Confessor, didst give us a splendid 
example of humility: grant that Thy 
servants, by following him, may 
despise earthly prosperity, and ever 
seek heavenly things. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
