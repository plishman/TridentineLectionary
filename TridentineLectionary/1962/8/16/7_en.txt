Receive, O most merciful God, the 
Sacrifice which we offer up to Thy 
majesty in honor of the holy Patriarch 
Joachim, the father of the Virgin Mary; 
that through his intercession, with that 
of his spouse and of his most blessed 
child, we may become worthy to obtain 
the perfect pardon of our sins, and to 
win eternal glory. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
