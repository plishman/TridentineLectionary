O God, who of all Thy Saints didst will 
to choose the blessed Joachim to be 
father to the Mother of Thy Son: grant, 
we beseech Thee, that we who honor 
his festival, may evermore experience 
his patronage. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
