The excellence of a fruit is always a sign of the quality of the tree which bore
it. In the case of St. Joachim, the Immaculate Conception of Mary reflects a 
splendid glory on the chaste union of her parents. The Gospels, speak of a 
sister of Our Lady who accompanied her even to the foot of the cross. 
According to some authorities she too was a daughter of Anna and of Joachim. 
His feast was first introduced into the Breviary by Julius II, who fixed the date of 
March 20. Leo XIII (Joachim Pecci) raised it to a double of the second class. In 
the reform of the Breviary carried out by Pius X, August 16th was the date
fixed.
The close relationship which existed between the Savior and St. Joachim 
confers on the latter a great dignity, raising him above other saints, so that the 
honor paid to him is reflected upon Christ Himself in a special manner and upon 
His Immaculate Mother.
