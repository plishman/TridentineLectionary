We beseech Thee, O almighty God, 
that through these Mysteries which we 
have received and by the merits and 
prayers of blessed Joachim, father of 
the Mother of Thy beloved Son, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, which plead for us, 
we may become worthy to receive Thy 
grace in this present life and eternal 
glory in the life to come. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
