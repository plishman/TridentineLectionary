Filled with the sacrificial food of Thy 
sacred body and precious blood, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, our God, that 
what we perform in pious devotion we 
may effectually obtain in assured 
redemption.
Having received Thy sacraments, O 
Lord, we beseech Thee, by the 
intercession of blessed Paul, Thine 
apostle, that what has been celebrated 
for his glory may profit unto our healing.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we may more and more 
closely follow the faith of Thy saints 
whose memory we venerate in 
partaking of Thy sacrament. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
