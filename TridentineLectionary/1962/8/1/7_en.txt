May the sacrifice offered to Thee, O 
Lord, by the intercession of blessed 
Peter ever vivify and strengthen us.
Sanctify the gifts of Thy people, O Lord,
through the prayers of Paul, Thine 
apostle, that what is pleasing to Thee 
by Thine own ordinance may become 
the more pleasing by the patronal 
influence of his supplication. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
May we devoutly deal with Thy 
mysteries, O Lord, for the honor of Thy 
holy Martyrs, and by them may both 
protection and joy be increased unto 
us. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
