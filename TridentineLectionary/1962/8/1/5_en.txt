At that time, Jesus came into the 
quarters of Cesarea Philippi: and he 
asked his disciples, saying: Whom do 
men say that the Son of man is? But 
they said: Some John the Baptist, and 
other some Elias, and others Jeremias,
or one of the prophets. Jesus saith to 
them:But whom do you say that I am? 
Simon Peter answered and said: Thou 
art Christ, the Son of the living God. 
And Jesus answering said to him: 
Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: 
because flesh and blood hath not 
revealed it to thee, but my Father who 
is in heaven. And I say to thee: That 
thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will 
build my church, and the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against it. And I will 
give to thee the keys of the kingdom of 
heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt 
bind upon earth, it shall be bound also 
in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt 
loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in
heaven.
