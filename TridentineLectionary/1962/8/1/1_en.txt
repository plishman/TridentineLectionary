O God, Who didst cause blessed Peter,
the apostle, to depart, loosed from his 
chains and unhurt, loose, we beseech 
Thee, the chains of our sins, and 
graciously keep all evils far from us.
O God, Who by the preaching of the 
blessed Apostle Paul didst teach the 
multitude of the Gentiles, grant us, we 
pray Thee, that, honoring his 
commemoration, we may experience 
the benefit of his patronal influence with
Thee. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
May the fruits of the fraternal crown of 
Thy Martyrs, O Lord, make us joyful, 
both to afford our faith increase of 
virtues and to console us with their 
manifold prayers. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
