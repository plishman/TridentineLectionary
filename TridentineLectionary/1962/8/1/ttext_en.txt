The chains with which St. Peter the Apostle was fettered from time to time 
have always been the object of veneration among the faithful. They are 
preserved in a basilica in Rome, which is called Saint Peter ad Vincula (in 
chains). The anniversary of the dedication of this church falls on August 1st. 
The chains of the Apostle Paul are preserved in the Basilica of St. Paul.
The reverence shown to the chains of the two apostles must have been 
very widely spread in olden times from the moment when Justinian I asked the 
Pope for "a portion of the chains of the holy apostles, if it were possible" and St. 
Gregory the Great relates that in his day the faithful were eagerly desirous of the
favor of possessing at least a small quantity of the filings of St. Paul's chains.
The chains of St. Peter are in two portions, one having eleven links, shaped
so as to hold the hands, and the other twenty-three links, at the end of which 
are two half circles to hold the neck. Only four links are preserved of the chains 
which bound St. Paul.
