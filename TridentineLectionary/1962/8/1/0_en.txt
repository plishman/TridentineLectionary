Now I know in very deed, that the Lord 
hath sent His angel, and hath 
delivered me out of the hand of Herod, 
and from all the expectation of the 
people of the Jews. (Ps. 138: 1-2) 
Lord, Thou hast proved me, and 
known me: Thou hast known my sitting 
down, and my rising up. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. Now I know in very deed, 
that the Lord hath sent His angel, and 
hath delivered me out of the hand of 
Herod, and from all the expectation of 
the people of the Jews.
