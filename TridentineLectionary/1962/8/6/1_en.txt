O God, Who in the glorious 
transfiguration of Thine only-begotten 
Son didst strengthen the sacraments of
faith by the testimony of the fathers, 
and Who didst wonderfully foreshow 
the perfect adoption of Thy children by 
a voice coming down in a shining 
cloud, mercifully grant that we be made
co-heirs of the King of glory Himself, 
and grant us to be sharers in that very 
glory. Through the same Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Sixtus II, Pope 
& Martyr, and Sts. Felicissimus & 
Agapitus, Martyrs)O God, who dost grant unto us to 
celebrate the heavenly birthday of Thy 
holy Martyrs Sixtus, Felicissimus and 
Agapitus: grant that we may rejoice in 
their fellowship in everlasting bliss. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
