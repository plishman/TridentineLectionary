Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that with the understanding of a 
purified mind we may follow those 
sacred mysteries of Thy Son's 
transfiguration which we celebrate with 
our solemn office. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(Commemoration of St. Sixtus II, Pope 
& Martyr, and Sts. Felicissimus & 
Agapitus, Martyrs)Grant us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
through the intercession of Thy holy 
martyrs Sixtus, Felicissimus and 
Agapitus, that what we take with the 
mouth, we may receive with a pure 
heart. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
