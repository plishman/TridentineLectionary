Thy lightnings enlightened the world: 
the earth shook and trembled. (Ps. 83: 
2- 3) How lovely are Thy tabernacles, 
O Lord of hosts! my soul longeth and 
fainteth for the courts of the Lord. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Thy 
lightnings enlightened the world: the 
earth shook and trembled.
