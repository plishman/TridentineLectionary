Dearly beloved, We have not followed 
cunningly devised fables, when we 
made known to you the power and 
presence of Our Lord Jesus Christ; but 
having been made eyewitnesses of His
majesty. For He received from God the 
Father honor and glory: this voice 
coming down to Him from the excellent 
glory, This is My beloved Son in Whom 
I am well pleased, hear ye Him. And 
this voice we heard brought from 
Heaven, when we were with Him in the 
holy mount. And we have the more firm
prophetical word, whereunto you do 
well to attend, as to a light that shineth 
in a dark place, until the day dawn, and
the day-star arise in your hearts.
