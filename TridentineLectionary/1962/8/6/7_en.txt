Sanctify, we beseech Thee, O Lord, the
gifts offered on the glorious 
transfiguration of Thine only-begotten 
Son, and by the splendors of that very 
illumination cleanse us from the stains 
of our sins. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Sixtus II, Pope 
& Martyr, and Sts. Felicissimus & 
Agapitus, Martyrs)We offer unto Thee, O Lord, the gifts of 
our devotion: may they please Thee as 
honoring Thy just ones, and through 
Thy mercy profit us unto salvation. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
