Grant us, we beseech Thee O almighty
God, to extinguish the flames of our evil
dispositions, as Thou didst grant 
blessed Lawrence to overcome the 
fires of his torments. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
