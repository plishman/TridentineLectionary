Praise and beauty are before Him: 
holiness and majesty in His sanctuary. 
(Ps. 95: 1) Sing ye to the Lord a new 
canticle; sing to the Lord all the earth. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Praise and 
beauty are before Him: holiness and 
majesty in His sanctuary.
