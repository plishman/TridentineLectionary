After the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul this is the greatest festival in the 
ancient Roman Liturgy. The terrible martyrdom endured by the famous 
archdeacon deeply impressed the generations that came immediately after him, 
for whom Lawrence became at Rome that which Stephen had been at 
Jerusalem.
In order to save from confiscation some property of the Church that had 
been intrusted to Lawrence, he sold it and gave the proceeds to the poor. As 
the enemies of the Church believed he had concealed the treasures and hoped 
to make him reveal their hiding-place, he was roasted alive on a gridiron. After 
an agony of hours he expired with a prayer on his lips for the conversion of the 
heathens. His ashes were placed in peace by the priest Justin in the cemetery 
of Cyriacus. Constantine erected a basilica on the spot, which has since been 
rebuilt several times. The gridiron is still preserved in the old Church of San 
Lorenzo in Lucina.
