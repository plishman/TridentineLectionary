Filled with Thy sacred gift, we humbly 
beseech Thee, O Lord, that what we 
celebrate with our homage duly given 
by the intercession of Thy blessed 
martyr Lawrence, we may also know as
an increase of Thy saving grace within 
us. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
