Brethren, He who soweth sparingly, 
shall also reap sparingly: and he who 
soweth in blessings, shall also reap of 
blessings. Everyone as he hath 
determined in his heart; not with 
sadness, or of necessity; for God loveth
a cheerful giver. And God is able to 
make all grace abound in you; that ye, 
always having all sufficiency in all 
things, may abound to every good 
work; as it is written, He hath dispersed
abroad, He hath given to the poor: His 
justice remaineth forever. And He that 
ministereth seed to the sower, will both 
give you bread to eat, and will multiply 
your seed, and increase the growth of 
the fruits of your justice.
