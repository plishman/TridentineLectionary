At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
Amen. amen, I say to you, unless the 
grain of wheat falling into the ground, 
die, itself remaineth alone: but if it die, it
bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth 
his life, shall lose it; and he that hateth 
his life in this world, keepeth it unto life 
eternal. If any man minister to Me, let 
him follow Me; and where I am, there 
also shall My minister be. If any man 
minister to Me, him will My Father 
honor.
