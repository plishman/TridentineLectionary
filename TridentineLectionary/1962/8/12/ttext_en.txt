St. Clare, born at Assisi in Umbria, was the first of the holy virgins whom St. 
Francis, consecrating to God, bound to Christlike poverty. On a visit to St. 
Francis, she expressed to him her desire to become a Spouse of Christ. To St. 
Francis had been given a little chapel called the Portiuncula by the Benedictine 
abbot of Monte Subasio. St. Francis gave to Clare the rule of St. Benedict to 
follow, as he desired to graft his new foundation on to the old Order, so as to 
give it a canonical basis, one already recognized by Holy Church. St. Francis 
determined that Clare should not imitate the rich convents of Benedictines then 
in Umbria, but should go back to the early traditions of Benedictine poverty; thus
it was that Pope Gregory IX was able to write to them before they had a rule of 
their own: "Now you are worthy daughters of the blessed Benedict." Her sister 
Agnes and other women soon joined her; they walked barefooted, slept on the 
ground, observed perpetual abstinence, and made poverty the basis of their 
lives.
St. Clare teaches us to have great devotion to the Holy Eucharist. In the 
midst of her extreme poverty she caused the Blessed Sacrament to be kept in a
silver case placed in an ivory pyx. One day when the Sarcens attacked the 
Convent of San Damiano, Clare herself held up the pyx containing the Blessed 
Sacrament like a shield between the nuns and the fury of the infidels. The 
enemy turned and fled. St. Clare passed to her heavenly reward, August 11, 
1253, and was canonized by Pope Alexander IV, two years later.
