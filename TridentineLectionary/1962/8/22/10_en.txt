Refreshed by divine gifts, we humbly 
beseech Thee, O Lord, that, by the 
intercession of the Blessed Virgin 
Mary, the solemnity of whose 
Immaculate Heart we have just 
venerated, we may be freed from 
present dangers and may attain to the 
joys of eternal life. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Timothy, 
Hippolytus and Symphorianus, 
Martyrs)We who are filled with the bounty of 
this divine gift, beseech Thee, O Lord 
our God, that through the intercession 
of Thy holy Martyrs Timotheus, 
Hippolytus, and Symphorian, we may 
partake thereof for evermore. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
