Almighty and everlasting God, who in 
the heart of the blessed Virgin Mary 
didst prepare a dwelling worthy of the 
Holy Ghost; grant in Thy mercy, that we
who with devout minds celebrate the 
festival of that immaculate heart, may 
be able to live according to Thine own 
Heart. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the same Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Timothy, 
Hippolytus and Symphorianus, 
Martyrs)O Lord, we beseech Thee, mercifully 
lend us Thy help: and through the 
intercession of Thy blessed Martyrs, 
Timothy, Hippolytus, and Symphorian, 
stretch forth upon us the right hand of 
Thy loving kindness. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
