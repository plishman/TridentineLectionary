Devotion to Mary's Heart always flourished in the Church, but its first official 
approval did not come till the beginning of the 19th century when Pius VI 
approved, for certain religious organizations, a Feast for the Most Pure Heart of 
Mary. The devotion was approved for the universal Church when Pius XII 
dedicated all mankind to the Heart of Mary in December, 1942, following this by 
the institution of the new Feast of the Immaculate Heart of the B. V. M.
Sts. Timothy, Hippolytus and Symphorian, Martyrs: 
St. Timothy of Antioch was martyred at Rome in the Fourth Century. He was
buried in a special grave in the gardens of Theona, not far from the cemetery of 
St. Paul. This was a recognition of the fact that he bore the same name as the 
great disciple of St. Paul.
St. Hippolytus (not the rival of Pope Callixtus) was a martyr of Porto. His 
history is wrapped in obscurity.
St. Symphorian is a celebrated martyr of Autun, beheaded under the reign 
of Aurelian about 180. When he was being led to martyrdom his pious mother 
called to him: "My son, my son, look up to heaven and behold Him Who reigns 
there. You are not being led to death, but to a better life."
