At that time, there stood by the cross of
Jesus, His Mother and His Mother's 
sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary 
Magdalen. When Jesus therefore had 
seen His Mother and the disciple 
standing whom He loved, He saith to 
His Mother: Woman, behold thy son. 
After that He saith to the disciple: 
Behold thy Mother. And from that hour 
the disciple took her to his own.
