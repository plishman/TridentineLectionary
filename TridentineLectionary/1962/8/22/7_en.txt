We who offer to Thy majesty the Lamb 
without spot, beseech Thee, O Lord, 
that our hearts may be kindled by the 
divine fire which in an ineffable manner 
inflamed the heart of the Blessed Virgin
Mary. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Timothy, 
Hippolytus and Symphorianus, 
Martyrs)May this sacrifice of Thy dedicated 
people be accepted by Thee, O Lord, in
honor of Thy Saints: to whose merits 
we attribute the help afforded us in 
tribulation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
