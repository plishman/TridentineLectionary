Let us come with confidence to the 
throne of grace, that we may obtain 
mercy, and may find grace for a timely 
help. (Ps. 44: 2) My heart hath uttered 
a good word: I speak my works to the 
King. Glory be to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in 
the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. Let us 
come with confidence to the throne of 
grace, that we may obtain mercy, and 
may find grace for a timely help.
