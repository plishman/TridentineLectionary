St. Hyacinth, the glorious apostle of Poland and Russia, was admitted into 
the Order of Friars Preachers by St. Dominic himself. By his example of holy 
living and by the power of his preaching, multitudes were converted, churches 
and convents were built, and 120,000 pagans and infidels were baptized by his 
hands. He died at Kracow in 1257, on the feast of the Assumption.
