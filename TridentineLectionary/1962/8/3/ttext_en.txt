The body of St. Stephen, the first martyr, with those of some other saints, 
was discovered near Jerusalem in the year 415. Later the body of the saint was
taken to Constantinople and finally to Rome, where it now lies beside that of St. 
Lawrence. The many miracles that occurred on the finding of St. Stephen's body
led to the institution of this festival, besides that of December 26th. A tradition 
states that Gamaliel, the teacher of St. Paul, had buried the body of St. Stephen
at his country house; Nicodemus and Abibas, son of Gamaliel, and Gamaliel 
himself, were also buried there.
