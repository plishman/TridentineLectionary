Grant us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, to 
imitate what we venerate, that we may 
learn to love even our enemies; for we 
celebrate the finding of him who knew 
how to pray even for his persecutors to 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son: Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
