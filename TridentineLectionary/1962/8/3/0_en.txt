Princes sat, and spoke against me; and
the wicked persecuted me: help me, O 
Lord, my God, for Thy servant was 
employed in Thy justifications. (Ps. 118:
1) Blessed are the undefiled in the 
way: who walk in the law of the Lord. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Princes sat, 
and spoke against me; and the wicked 
persecuted me: help me, O Lord, my 
God, for Thy servant was employed in 
Thy justifications.
