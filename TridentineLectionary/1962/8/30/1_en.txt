O Almighty God, the Giver of all good 
gifts, Who didst will that blessed Rose, 
bedewed with Thy heavenly graces, 
should blossom forth in the Indies as a 
lovely flower of virginity and patience: 
grant to us Thy servants that, hastening
in the fragrance of her sweetness, we 
may be found worthy to become a 
sweet fragrance of Christ: Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Felix & 
Adauctus, Martyrs)We humbly entreat Thy Majesty, O 
Lord, that as Thou dost give us 
continual joy in the commemoration of 
Thy Saints, so Thou wouldst evermore 
defend us in view of their prayers. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
