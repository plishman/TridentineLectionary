St. Rose, the first canonized saint of the New World, was born at Lima in 
1586. She received the name of Isabella in Baptism, but one day her mother 
saw a beautiful rose drooping over the baby's cradle, and ever afterwards 
called her Rose. She was an obedient child; her mortifications were most 
severe. She prayed, worked, and wept for the conversion of sinners; she 
excelled in her love for holy purity. She lived a life of simplicity and prayer in a 
small hut in a corner of her father's garden; the birds would visit her and sing 
with her the praises of God. The Savior frequently appeared to her. Her devotion
to the Passion of Our Lord was remarkable as were her own sufferings. Her bed
was strewn with glass shards, with nails and thorns; she wore chafing hair-cloth;
her head was crowned with painful thorns skillfully concealed by roses. She died
August 26, 1617. Her Office was written by the eminent Cardinal Bona.
Commemoration of Sts. Felix and Adauctus, Martyrs: St. Felix suffered 
martyrdom in the year 303, and was joined by Adauctus, who shared his martyr 
crown. A painting of the Sixth Century depicts both of them with the priestly 
tonsure. Felix is an old man, but Adauctus stands on the right hand side, 
although he is young and beardless.
