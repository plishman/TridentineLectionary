May the offering of Thy consecrated 
people be accepted by Thee, O Lord, in
honor of Thy saints, by whose merits it 
knoweth that it hath received aid in time
of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Felix & 
Adauctus, Martyrs)Have regard, O Lord, to the offerings of
Thy people, and while they celebrate 
this Sacrifice in honor of Thy Saints, 
may they know that it avails to their 
own salvation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
