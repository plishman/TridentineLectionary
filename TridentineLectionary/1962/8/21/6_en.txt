May this saving Victim, O Lord, inflame 
us with that fire of love with which it 
vehemently kindled the heart of 
blessed Jane Frances, burning it away 
with the flames of eternal charity. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
