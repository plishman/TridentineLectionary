The just man will give his heart to 
resort early to the Lord his Maker, and 
he will pray in the sight of the Most 
High. He will open his mouth in prayer, 
and will ask pardon for his sins. Then, if
it pleases the Lord Almighty, He will fill 
him with the spirit of understanding; 
and he will pour forth his words of 
wisdom as showers, and in prayer give 
thanks to the Lord, Who will direct his 
knowledge and his counsel, as he 
meditates upon His mysteries. He will 
show the wisdom of what he has 
learned and glory in the Law of the 
Lordâ€™s covenant. Many will praise his 
understanding; his fame can never be 
effaced; unfading will be his memory, 
through all generations his name will 
live; peoples will speak of his wisdom, 
the assembly will sing his praises.
