St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux, was born in Burgundy, in 1091. He was at 
once a reformer of the monastic life, a preacher of the Crusade, a Doctor of the 
Universal Church, a worker of miracles, a peace-maker between kings, princes 
and peoples, the oracle of Popes, and the champion of the Roman See against 
schisms and heresies. The mortal frame of the saint, consumed by penance 
and by sickness, could scarcely contain his soul on fire for the glory of God. This
fire communicated itself to those around him; his secretaries had difficulty in 
recording the numerous miraculous cures which he worked by the touch of his 
hand, or, simply by a blessing. On a visit to Italy he installed at the ancient 
Abbey ad aquas Salvias, as first abbot, Bernardo Pisano, who became Pope 
Eugenius III.
He died at Clairvaux, August 20, 1153, and was buried at the foot of the 
Blessed Virgin's altar. Pius VIII declared him a Doctor of the Church.
