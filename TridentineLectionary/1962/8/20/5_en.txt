At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
You are the salt of the earth. But if the 
salt lose its savor, wherewith shall it be 
salted? It is good for nothing any more 
but to be cast out, and to be trodden on
by men. You are the light of the world. A
city seated on a mountain cannot be 
hid. Neither do men light a candle and 
put it under a bushel, but upon a 
candlestick, that it may shine to all that 
are in the house. So let your light shine 
before men, that they may see your 
good works, and glorify your Father 
who is in heaven. Do not think that I am
come to destroy the law, or the 
prophets. I am not come to destroy, but
to fulfill. For amen I say unto you, till 
heaven and earth pass, one jot, or one 
tittle shall not pass of the law, till all be 
fulfilled. He therefore that shall break 
one of these least commandments, and
shall so teach men, shall be called the 
least in the kingdom of heaven. But he 
that shall do and teach, he shall be 
called great in the kingdom of heaven.
