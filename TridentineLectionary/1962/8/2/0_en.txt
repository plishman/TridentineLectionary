The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 
wherefore He hath anointed me: to 
preach the gospel to the poor, He hath 
sent me to heal the contrite of heart. 
(Ps. 77: 1) Attend, O My people, to My 
law: incline your ear to the words of My
mouth. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 
wherefore He hath anointed me: to 
preach the gospel to the poor, He hath 
sent me to heal the contrite of heart.
