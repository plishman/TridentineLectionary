God, Who didst cause blessed 
Alphonsus Mary, Thy Confessor and 
Bishop, faithfully to dispense and 
preach this divine mystery: grant, by 
his merits and prayers, that Thy faithful
may both frequently receive it, and, 
receiving it, praise it forever. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Stephen I, 
Pope & Martyr)Since Thy Church has been nourished 
by the sacred repast, govern her in 
Thy clemency, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, so that under the guidance of 
Thy mighty rule she may enjoy greater 
freedom and abiding integrity of 
religion. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
