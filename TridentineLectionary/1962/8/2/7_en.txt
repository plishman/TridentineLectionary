O Lord Jesus Christ, burn our hearts 
thoroughly with the heavenly fire of this
sacrifice for an odor of sweetness, 
Thou Who didst grant to blessed 
Alphonsus Mary both to celebrate 
these mysteries and, through them, to 
offer himself to Thee a holy victim. 
Who lives and reigns with God the 
Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Stephen I, 
Pope & Martyr)In Thy loving kindness, we beseech 
Thee, Lord, be moved by the offering 
of our gifts and enlighten Thy Church: 
that Thy flock may prosper everywhere
and the shepherds, under Thy 
guidance, may be rendered acceptable
to Thee. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
