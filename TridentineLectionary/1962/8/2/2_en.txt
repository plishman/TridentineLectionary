Dearly beloved, be strong in the grace
which is in Christ Jesus, and the things
which thou hast heard of me before 
many witnesses, the same commend 
to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach
others also. Labor as a good soldier of
Christ Jesus. No man being a soldier 
to God, entangleth himself with worldly
business: that he may please Him to 
Whom he hath engaged himself. For 
he also that striveth for the mastery, is 
not crowned, except he strive lawfully. 
The husbandman that laboreth, must 
first partake of the fruits. Understand 
what I say: for the Lord will give thee 
understanding in all things.
