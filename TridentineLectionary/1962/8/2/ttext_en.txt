St. Alphonsus was born of noble parents near Naples, Italy, in 1696, and 
died in 1787. In the midst of many evils he appeared with a three-fold mission 
as Doctor, Bishop, and founder of a new religious Order. As Doctor he became 
the great teacher of Moral Theology; he found the middle way between the two 
extremes of the lax and the over-rigorous, and by his ascetic writings he spread 
among the people Catholic piety, devotion to Our Lady, to Jesus in the Blessed 
Sacrament, to the Passion, and defended the supreme rights of the Church and 
of the Pope.
He was devoted in a special manner to the Holy Eucharist, and left a 
beautiful little book entitled Visits to the Blessed Sacrament.
Commemoration of St. Stephen: St. Stephen, by birth a Roman, was made 
Pope on May 3, 253, and governed the Church for three years. He decided the 
question of the validity of Baptism when administered by heretics, ordering
that the tradition should be preserved according to which it was sufficient that 
they receive confirmation. He was murdered by the Emperor's soldiers while 
seated in his episcopal chair in the catacombs, during the celebration of Mass, 
August 2, 257.
