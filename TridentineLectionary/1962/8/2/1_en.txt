God, Who through blessed Alphonsus
Mary, Thy Confessor and Bishop, fired
with zeal for souls, didst cause Thy 
Church to bring forth a new progeny, 
we beseech Thee that, being taught by
his wholesome precepts, and 
strengthened by his example, we may 
be enabled happily to come unto Thee.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Stephen I, 
Pope & Martyr)O Eternal Shepherd, do Thou look 
favorably upon Thy flock, which we 
beseech Thee to guard and keep for 
evermore through the Blessed 
Stephen, Thy Martyr and Supreme 
Pontiff, whom Thou didst choose to be 
the chief shepherd of the whole 
Church. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
