At that time, The Lord appointed also
other seventy-two; and He sent them 
two and two before His face into every 
city and place whither He Himself was 
to come. And He said to them: The 
harvest indeed is great, but the 
laborers are few: pray ye therefore the 
Lord of the harvest, that He send 
laborers into His harvest. Go, behold I 
send you as lambs among wolves. 
Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor 
shoes; and salute no man by the way. 
Into whatsoever house you enter, first 
say, Peace be to this house: and if the 
son of peace be there, your peace 
shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall 
return to you. And in the same house 
remain, eating and drinking such 
things as they have: for the laborer is 
worthy of his hire. Remove not from 
house to house. And into what city 
soever you enter, and they receive 
you, eat such things as are set before 
you; and heal the sick that are therein; 
and say to them, The kingdom of God 
is come nigh unto you.
