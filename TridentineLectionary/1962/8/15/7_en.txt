May our offering of due service rise 
unto Thee, O Lord: and through the 
prayer of the most Blessed Virgin 
Mary, assumed by Thee into heaven, 
may our hearts be set on fire with love 
and ever yearn for Thee. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
