Through the merits and prayers of the
Blessed Virgin Mary, by Thee assumed 
into heaven, may we, O Lord, who 
have received the sacraments of 
salvation, come to the glory of the 
resurrection. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
