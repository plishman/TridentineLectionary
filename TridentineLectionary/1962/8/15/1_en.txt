Almighty everlasting God, who hast 
taken body and soul into heaven the 
Immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of Thy 
Son: grant, we beseech Thee, that by 
steadfastly keeping heaven as our 
goal we may be counted worthy to join 
her in glory. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
