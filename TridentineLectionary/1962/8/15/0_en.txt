A great sign appeared in heaven: A
woman clothed with the sun, and the 
moon under her feet, and on her head 
a crown of twelve stars. (Ps. 97: 1) 
Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: 
because He hath done wonderful 
things. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. A 
great sign appeared in heaven: A
woman clothed with the sun, and the 
moon under her feet, and on her head 
a crown of twelve stars.
