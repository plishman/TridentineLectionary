The Lord hath blessed thee by His 
power, because by thee He hath 
brought our enemies to nought. 
Blessed art thou, O daughter, by the 
Lord the most high God, above all 
women upon the earth. Blessed be the 
Lord who made heaven and earth, 
who hath directed thee to the cutting 
off the head of the prince of our 
enemies. Because He hath so 
magnified thy name this day that thy 
praise shall not depart out of the 
mouth of men who shall be mindful of 
the power of the Lord, for ever: for that 
thou hast not spared thy life, by reason
of the distress and tribulation of thy 
people; but hast prevented our ruin in 
the presence of our God. Thou art the 
glory of Jerusalem, thou art the joy of 
Israel, thou art the honor of our people.
