Among the feasts of the Blessed Virgin that of the dormitio sanctae Mariae, 
or of her bodily assumption into heaven, was from very early times the most 
solemn and the most widely observed. In the time of Pope Sergius I a solemn 
procession proceeded to St. Mary Major, where Mass was celebrated. It was 
customary to carry images of the Savior and of His Blessed Mother in this 
procession; outside of Rome a similar ceremony was observed.
It should, however, be borne in mind that though the divine maternity of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary may be regarded as the immediate reason of her 
Assumption into heaven, yet the first and formal reason of this privilege is to be 
sought in her Immaculate Conception. It is true, indeed, that the dignity of the 
Mother of the Incarnate Word was the primary reason for which God preserved 
the Immaculate Conception of Mary from all stain of original sin – and in this 
sense the Gregorian Sacramentary rightly attributes the reason of the bodily 
resurrection of the Blessed Virgin to her prerogative as Mother of the Word – but
in order to express this truth with perfect accuracy, it is necessary to say that the
formal reason for the preservation of her body from corruption was precisely her
immunity from all stain of original sin.
