At that time: Elizabeth was filled with 
the Holy Ghost. And she cried out with 
a loud voice and said: Blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit 
of thy womb. And whence is this to me
that the mother of my Lord should 
come to me? For behold as soon as 
the voice of thy salutation sounded in 
my ears, the infant in my womb leaped
for joy. And blessed art thou that hast 
believed, because those things shall 
be accomplished that were spoken to 
thee by the Lord. And Mary said: My 
soul doth magnify the Lord. And my 
spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior. 
Because He hath regarded the humility
of His handmaid: for behold from 
henceforth all generations shall call me
blessed. Because He that is mighty 
hath done great things to me: and holy
is His name. And His mercy is from 
generations to generations to them 
that fear Him.
