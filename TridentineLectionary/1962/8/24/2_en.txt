Brethren, you are the body of Christ, 
and members of member. And God 
indeed hath set some in the Church, 
first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly
doctors, after that miracles, then the 
graces of healings, helps, 
governments, kinds of tongues, 
interpretations of speeches. Are all 
apostles? Are all prophets? Are all 
doctors? Are all workers of miracles? 
Have all the grace of healing? Do all 
speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 
But be ye zealous for the better gifts.
