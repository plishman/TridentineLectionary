May the pledge of everlasting 
redemption, which we have received, O
Lord, be unto us, we beseech Thee, by 
the intercession of blessed 
Bartholomew Thine apostle, an aid 
alike for the present and the future life. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
