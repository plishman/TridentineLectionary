Commemorating the feast of Thy 
blessed apostle Bartholomew, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, that we may 
obtain Thy blessings by his aid for 
whom we immolate sacrifices of praise 
to Thee. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
