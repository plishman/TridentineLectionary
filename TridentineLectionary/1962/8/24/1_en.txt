Almighty, eternal God, Who hast 
bestowed on us the august and holy 
joy of this day by the festival of Thy 
blessed apostle Bartholomew, grant 
unto Thy Church, we beseech Thee, 
both to love what he believed and to 
preach what he taught. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
