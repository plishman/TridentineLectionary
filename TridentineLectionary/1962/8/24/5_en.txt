At that time, Jesus went out into a 
mountain to pray, and He passed the 
whole night in the prayer of God: and 
when day was come, He called unto 
Him His disciples; and He chose twelve
of them (whom also He named 
apostles), Simon whom He surnamed 
Peter, and Andrew his brother, James 
and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 
Matthew and Thomas, James the son 
of Alpheus, and Simon who is called 
Zelotes, and Jude the brother of 
James, and Judas Iscariot, who was 
the traitor. And coming down with them,
He stood in a plain place, and the 
company of His disciples, and a very 
great multitude of people from all Judea
and Jerusalem, and the seacoast, both 
of Tyre and Sidon, who were come to 
hear Him, and to be healed of their 
diseases. And they that were troubled 
with unclean spirits were cured. And all 
the multitude sought to touch Him, for 
virtue went out from Him, and healed 
all.
