In the Gospel of St. John, Bartholomew is not mentioned among the 
Apostles, but it is stated that Philip and Nathanael came to Jesus, and that 
Jesus said of Nathanael, "the IsraeIite in whom was no guile." In the list of the 
apostles in the other Gospels, Nathanael is not mentioned, but after Philip is 
placed Bartholomew. The Redeemer chose all the apostles at once, and 
formed them from the beginning into a hierarchial group with St. Peter at their 
head, in order to show us that the rightful priesthood instituted by Christ is that 
which is derived in unbroken succession from the twelve apostles chosen by 
Our Savior, and being in communion with the See of Peter, is also in 
communion with the entire Catholic episcopate. Bartholomew is said to have 
preached the faith over a great part of Asia and suffered martyrdom in Armenia,
where he was flayed alive. His body was transferred many times, and is now 
believed to repose in the Church of St. Bartholomew on an island in the Tiber.
