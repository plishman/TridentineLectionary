At that time, the disciples came to 
Jesus, saying, Who, thinkest Thou, is 
the greater in the kingdom of Heaven? 
And Jesus calling unto Him a little child,
set him in the midst of them, and said, 
Amen I say to you, unless you be 
converted, and become as little 
children, you shall not enter into the 
kingdom of Heaven. Whosoever 
therefore shall humble himself as this 
little child, he is the greater in the 
kingdom of Heaven; and he that shall 
receive one such little child in My 
name, receiveth Me.
