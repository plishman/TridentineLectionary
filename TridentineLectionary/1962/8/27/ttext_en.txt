St. Joseph Calasanctius was born in Aragon in 1556. Having become a 
priest it was revealed to him that he should teach the children of the poor. He 
founded the Order of the Poor Clerks Regular of the Pious Schools of the 
Mother of God. He was ever a devout pilgrim at the shrines of the martyrs, and 
daily visited the seven Churches of Rame, where he lived for fifty years. He died
August 25, 1648.
