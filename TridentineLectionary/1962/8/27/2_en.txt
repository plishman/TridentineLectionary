The Lord conducted the just through 
the right ways, and showed him the 
kingdom of God, and gave him the 
knowledge of the holy things; made him
honorable in his labors, and 
accomplished his labors. In the deceit 
of them that overreached him, He stood
by him, and made him honorable. He 
kept him safe from his enemies, and 
defended him from seducers, and gave
him a strong conflict, that he might 
overcome, and know that wisdom is 
mightier than all. She forsook not the 
just when he was sold, but delivered 
him from sinners: she went down with 
him into the pit, and in bands she left 
him not, till she brought him the sceptre
of the kingdom, and power against 
those that oppressed him; and showed 
them to be liars that had accused him: 
and the Lord our God gave him 
everlasting glory.
