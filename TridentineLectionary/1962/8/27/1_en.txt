O God, Who, through St. Joseph, Thy 
Confessor, didst vouchsafe to provide 
Thy Church with a new aid for the 
education of youth in the spirit of piety 
and understanding, grant us, we 
beseech Thee, so to do and to teach 
after his example that we may attain 
eternal rewards. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
