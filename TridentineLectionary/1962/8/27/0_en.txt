Come, children, harken to me: I will 
teach you the fear of the Lord. (Ps. 33: 
2) I will bless the Lord at all times: His 
praise shall be ever in my mouth. V. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Come, 
children, harken to me: I will teach you 
the fear of the Lord.
