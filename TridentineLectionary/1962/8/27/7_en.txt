We heap Thine altar, O Lord, with gifts 
offered to Thee, that they may be made
effectual for mercy by his supplication 
by whose patronage Thou hast granted
us to be assisted. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
