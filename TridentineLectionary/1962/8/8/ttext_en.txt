St. John Mary Vianney was born at Dardilly, France, in 1786. He was a 
farmhand until his nineteenth year, when he began his studies for the 
priesthood. His talents were poor, and his progress slow. He was ordained at 
Grenoble in 1815; he became parish priest of Ars in 1818. That little town was 
the scene of his marvelous labors until his holy death, August 4, 1859. He was 
canonized May 31, 1925, by Pope Pius XI. For forty years his food and sleep 
were insufficient to sustain human life; during the last ten years of his life he 
spent from sixteen to eighteen hours a day in the confessional. Enlightened by 
God, he could read hearts and soften the most hardened sinner. He healed the 
sick and cast out devils; like his Master he was openly persecuted, calumniated 
and hated by wicked men. His little parish attracted thousands of people. 
Towards the end of his life 158,000 people visited Ars in a single year. He 
founded an orphanage for girls, trusting its support to Divine Providence. He 
had the gift of prophecy, and told many souls what the future held in store for 
them. He is in a special manner the model for all parish priests.
Commemoration of Sts. Cyriacus, Largus, and Smaragdus, Martyrs:
St. Cyriacus was a holy deacon of Rome under Popes Marcellinus and 
Marcellus. With Largus, Smaragdus, and about twenty others he was crowned 
with martyrdom in 303, in the persecution of Diocletian. The occasion of the 
translation of their remains many years later to a church dedicated to them led 
to the institution of a festival in their memory. St. Cyriacus is invoked for 
diseases of the eye, and against diabolical possessions.
