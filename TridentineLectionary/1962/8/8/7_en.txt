We offer Thee, O Lord, sacrifices of 
praise in commemoration of Thy saints,
by whom we trust to be delivered from 
evils both present and future. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Cyriacus, 
Largus, & Smaragdus, Martyrs)May our offering, O Lord, be 
acceptable in Thy sight, and be for us 
a help to salvation through the prayers 
of those whose festival it is offered. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
