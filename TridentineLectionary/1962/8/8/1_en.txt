Almighty and merciful God, Who by 
pastoral zeal, the yoke of prayer, and 
the ardor of penance hast made 
glorious St. John Mary; grant, we 
beseech Thee, that by his example and
intercession we may be enabled to gain
for Christ the souls of our brethren and 
with them attain to everlasting glory. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Cyriacus, 
Largus, & Smaragdus, Martyrs)O God, Who dost gladden us with the
solemn yearly festival of Thy holy 
Martyrs, Cyriacus, Largus, and 
Smaragdus, mercifully grant that we 
may imitate the virtue of their 
martyrdom whose feast day we now 
celebrate. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
