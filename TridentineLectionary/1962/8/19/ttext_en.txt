St. John Eudes was born at Ri, France, November 14, 1601; he made 
brilliant studies at Cren; became an oratorian and a priest; founded, in 1641, the
Congregation of Our Lady of Refuge (Good Shepherd Nuns); left the Oratory 
and founded, in 1643, the Society of Jesus and Mary (Eudists) for the education
of priests and for missionary work; instituted the feasts of the Hearts of Jesus 
and Mary; wrote a number of ascetical books; died at Cren, August 19, 1680.
He was noted as a preacher and for his great love of God. He made a 
special vow always to do what was most pleasing to God. In the confessional all
the fire of his pulpit oratory disappeared and he was as gentle as a lamb.
