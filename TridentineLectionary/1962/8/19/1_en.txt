O God, Who didst wonderfully inflame 
blessed John Thy confessor to promote
the public worship of the Sared Hearts 
of Jesus and Mary, and through him 
didst will to found new religious families
in the Church; grant, we beseech Thee,
that we who venerate his merits may 
also be taught by the example of his 
virtues. . Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
