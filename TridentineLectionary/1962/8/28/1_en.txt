Give ear to our prayers, O almighty 
God, and, by the intercession of 
blessed Augustine, Thy confessor and 
bishop, graciously grant the effect of 
Thine accustomed mercy to those in 
whom Thou dost encourage a strong 
trust in the kindness which is their 
hope. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Hermes, 
Martyr)O God, Who didst strengthen blessed 
Hermes, Thy martyr, with the virtue of 
constancy in his suffering, grant us, in 
imitation of him, to despise the 
prosperity of the world for love of Thee,
and not to fear worldly adversity. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
