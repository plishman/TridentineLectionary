We beseech Thee, O Lord, that 
blessed Augustine, Thy Bishop and 
illustrious Doctor, may approach to pray
for us, that these Thy sacrifices may 
bring us salvation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Hermes, 
Martyr)Filled with heavenly blessings, O Lord, 
we beseech Thy mercy that, by the 
intercession of blessed Hermes, Thy 
martyr, we may feel the salutary effects
of that which we humbly perform. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
