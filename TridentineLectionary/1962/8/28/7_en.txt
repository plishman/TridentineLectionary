May the holy prayer of St.Augustine, 
Thy Bishop and Doctor, fail us not, O 
Lord: may it render our offerings 
acceptable, and ever obtain for us Thy 
pardon. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Hermes, 
Martyr)We offer Thee, O Lord, the sacrifice of 
praise in commemoration of Thy saints;
grant, we beseech Thee, that what hath
conferred glory on them may profit us 
unto salvation. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
