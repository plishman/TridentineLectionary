St. Augustine was born at Tagaste, Africa, in 354. In his early life he 
abandoned the pious teaching of his mother and fell into grievous sins. Finally 
at Milan he was converted by the example and words of St. Ambrose and 
baptized in 387. His mother, St. Monica, died seven months later when, with her
son, she was about to return to Africa. St. Augustine remembered her always in
his prayers and offered the Holy Mass for her soul. He was made bishop of 
Hippo in 395, and established a common life for his clergy. The rule of St. 
Augustine is drawn from his 211th epistle which he wrote for nuns and which 
later was adapted for the men. He is one of the few saints who was appreciated 
even during his lifetime; his contemporaries recognized his sanctity and his 
learning. No council was held at that time in Africa of which the Bishop of the 
small city of Hippo was not the leading spirit. He died in 430. His body was 
saved by African bishops from the profanation of the Vandals. It was taken first 
to Sardinia and then to Pavia, where it is still preserved in Ciel d'Oro.
Commemoration of St. Hermes: St. Hermes, a prefect of Rome, suffered 
under Emperor Hadrian, about 132, in the time of Pope Telesphorus.
