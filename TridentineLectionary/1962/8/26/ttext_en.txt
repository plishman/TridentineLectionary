St. Zephyrinus, a Pope of the Third Century, after a lengthy reign in the 
course of which he earned the title of martyr by his suffering, died a holy death. 
He is said to have forbidden the use of wooden chalices in the celebration of the
Mass and to have prescribed that all the faithful should receive Communion on 
Easter Day. He defended the Church against heresies and especially of those 
who denied the Trinity.
