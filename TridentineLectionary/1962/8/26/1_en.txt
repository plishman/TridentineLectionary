Eternal Shepherd, regard graciously 
Thy flock, and keep it with an 
everlasting protection, by the 
intercession of blessed Zephyrinus thy 
Martyr and Sovereign Pontiff, whom 
Thou hast constituted shepherd of the 
whole Church. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
