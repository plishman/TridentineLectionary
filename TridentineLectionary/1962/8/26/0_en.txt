Simon Peter, if thou lovest Me, feed My
lambs, feed My sheep. (Ps. 29: 1) I will
extol Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast 
upheld me: and hast not made my 
enemies to rejoice over me. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Simon Peter,
if thou lovest Me, feed My lambs, feed 
My sheep.
