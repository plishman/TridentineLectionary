God forbid that I should glory, save in 
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ: by 
whom the world is crucified to me, and 
I to the world. (Ps 131:1) O Lord, 
remember David and all his meekness.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. God forbid 
that I should glory, save in the cross of 
our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom the 
world is crucified to me, and I to the 
world.
