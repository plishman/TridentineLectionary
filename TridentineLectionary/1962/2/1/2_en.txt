Brethren, who shall separate us from 
the love of Christ? shall tribulation? or 
distress? or famine? or nakedness? or 
danger? or persecution? or the sword? 
(As it is written, for Thy sake we are put
to death all the day long: we are 
accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) 
But in all these things we overcome 
because of Him that hath loved us. For 
I am sure that neither death, nor life, 
nor angels, nor principalities, nor 
powers, nor things present, nor things 
to come, nor might, nor height, nor 
depth, nor any other creature shall be 
able to separate us from the love of 
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
