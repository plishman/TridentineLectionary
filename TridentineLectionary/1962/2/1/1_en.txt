Have regard to our weakness, O 
almighty God, and since the burden of 
our deeds is grievous to us, grant that 
the glorious intercession of blessed 
Ignatius Thy martyr and bishop may 
protect us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
