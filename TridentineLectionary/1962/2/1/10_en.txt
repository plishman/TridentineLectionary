Refreshed by the participation in the 
holy gift, we beseech Thee, O Lord our 
God, that by the intercession of 
blessed Ignatius Thy martyr and 
bishop, we may experience the effect 
of that which we celebrate. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
