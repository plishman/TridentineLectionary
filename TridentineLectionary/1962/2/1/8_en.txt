Graciously accept, O Lord, the 
offerings dedicated unto Thee, through 
the merits of blessed Ignatius Thy 
martyr and bishop; grant that they may 
become our perpetual support. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
