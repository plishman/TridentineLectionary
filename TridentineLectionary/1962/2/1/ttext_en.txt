St. Ignatius was the third successor of St. Peter at Antioch; a tradition says that 
he was held on the knee of Our Lord when the Savior spoke the words "Suffer 
the little children to come unto rne." During the persecution of Trajan he was 
condemned to death and sent in chains to Rome. While on the way he wrote 
letters to various churches; he rejoiced when he heard the roaring of the lions
set loose to devour him. He Was martyred at Rome on October 17, about the 
year 110. He is commemorated every day in the prayer which precedes the 
Pater Noster, known as the "Great Intercession."
