At that time, Jesus said to the 
multitudes, If any man come to me, and
hate not his father and mother and wife
and children and brethren and sisters, 
yea and his own life also, he cannot be 
my disciple. And whosoever doth not 
carry his cross, and come after Me, 
cannot be My disciple. For which of 
you having a mind to build a tower, 
doth not first sit down and reckon the 
charges that are necessary, whether 
he have wherewithal to finish it; lest 
after he hath laid the foundation, and 
is not able to finish all that see it begin 
to mock him, saying. This man began 
to build, and was not able to finish? Or 
what king about to go and make war 
against another king, doth not first sit 
down and think whether he be able 
with ten thousand to meet him that 
with twenty thousand cometh against 
him? Or else, whilst the other is yet 
afar off, sending an embassy, he 
desireth conditions of peace. So 
likewise everyone of you that doth not 
renounce all that he possesseth, 
cannot be My disciple.
