Dearly beloved, blessed is the man 
that endureth temptation: for when he 
hath been proved, he shall receive the 
crown of life, which God hath promised 
to them that love Him. Let no man, 
when he is tempted, say that he is 
tempted by God. For God is not a 
tempter of evils, and He tempteth no 
man. But every man is tempted by his 
own concupiscence, being drawn 
away and allured. Then when 
concupiscence hath conceived it 
bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is 
completed, begetteth death. Do not err 
therefore, my dearest brethren. Every 
best gift, and every perfect gift, is from 
above; coming down from the Father 
of lights, with Whom there is no 
change, nor shadow of alteration. For 
of His own will hath He begotten us by 
the word of truth, that we might be 
some beginning of His creature.
