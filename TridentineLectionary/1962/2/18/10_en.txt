Our strength renewed from having 
shared in Thy sacred gift, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord our God, that by the 
intercession of Blessed Simeon, Thy 
martyr and bishop, we may ever feel 
the mighty power of the sacrament we 
worship. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
