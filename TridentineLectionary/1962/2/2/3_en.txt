We have received Thy mercy, O God, 
in the midst of Thy temple; according to
Thy Name, O God, so also is Thy 
praise unto the ends of the earth. As 
we have heard, so have we seen, in 
the city of our God, and in His holy 
mountain.
(After Septuagesima, the Alleluia is 
omitted and the Tract is said instead.)
