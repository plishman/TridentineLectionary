Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I send
My Angel, and he shall prepare the 
way before My face; and presently the 
Lord, whom you seek, and the Angel of
the testament, whom you desire, shall 
come to His temple. Behold He 
cometh, saith the Lord of hosts; and 
who shall be able to think of the day of 
His coming? and who shall stand to 
see Him? for He is like a refining fire, 
and like the fuller's herb; and He shall 
sit refining and cleansing the silver, and
He shall purify the sons of Levi, and 
shall refine them as gold, and as silver,
and they shall offer sacrifices to the 
Lord in justice. And the sacrifice of 
Juda and of Jerusalem shall please the
Lord, as in the days of old, and in the 
ancient years; saith the Lord almighty.
