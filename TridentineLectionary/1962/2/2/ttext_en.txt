(or Candlemas Day) The celebration of this feast began very early at Jerusalem.
It commemorates not only the Purification of the Blessed Virgin but also the 
meeting of Simeon and the Infant Jesus in the Temple. In the East it was 
regarded as a feast of Our Lord; Pope Sergius I ordered that it should be 
preceded by a penitential procession to St. Mary Major, and thus it became 
predominantly a feast of the Blessed Virgin. The blessing of the candles as a 
peculiar rite dates only from the Tenth Century. Candles were distributed at 
Rome at all nocturnal processions; it is probable that this custom has been 
retained on this day because of the words of the canticle of Simeon near the 
end of the Gospel, "Lumen ad revelationem gentium."
