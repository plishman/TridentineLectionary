We beseech Thee, O Lord our God, 
that the most holy Mysteries, which 
Thou hast given us as a safeguard for 
our regenerated nature, may, through 
the intercession of blessed Mary ever 
Virgin, be to us a healing remedy, both 
for the present and for the future. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
