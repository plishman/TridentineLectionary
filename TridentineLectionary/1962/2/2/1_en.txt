Almighty and everlasting God, we 
humbly beseech Thy Majesty, that as 
Thine only-begotten Son was this day 
presented in the temple in the 
substance of our flesh, so Thou 
wouldst cause us too to be presented 
unto Thee with purified hearts. Through
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
