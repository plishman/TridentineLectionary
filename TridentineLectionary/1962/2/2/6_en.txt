At that time, after the days of Mary's 
purification according to the law of 
Moses, were accomplished, they 
carried Jesus to Jerusalem, to present 
Him to the Lord; as it is written in the 
law of the Lord: Every male opening 
the womb, shall be called holy to the 
Lord; and to offer sacrifice, according 
as it is written in the law of the Lord, a 
pair of turtle doves, or two young 
pigeons. And behold there was a man 
in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this 
man was just and devout, waiting for 
the consolation of Isræl, and the Holy 
Spirit was in him: and he received an 
answer from the Holy Spirit, that he 
should not see death, before he had 
seen the Christ of the Lord. And he 
came by the Spirit into the temple. And 
when His parents brought in the Child 
Jesus, to do for Him according to the 
custom of the law, he also took Him 
into his arms, and blessed God, and 
said: Now Thou dost dismiss Thy 
servant, O Lord, according to Thy word
in peace; because my eyes have seen 
Thy salvation, which Thou hast 
prepared before the face of all peoples;
a light to the revelation of the Gentiles, 
and the glory of Thy people Isræl.
