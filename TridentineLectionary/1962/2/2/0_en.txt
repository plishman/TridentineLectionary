We have received Thy mercy, O God, 
in the midst of Thy temple; according to
Thy name, O God, so also is Thy 
praise unto the ends of the earth; Thy 
right hand is full of justice. (Ps. 47: 2) 
Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to 
be praised, in the city of God, in His 
holy mountain. Glory be to the Father, 
and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now, and 
ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen. We have received Thy mercy, 
O God, in the midst of Thy temple; 
according to Thy name, O God, so also
is Thy praise unto the ends of the 
earth; Thy right hand is full of justice.
