St. Romuald, at the age of 20, undertook a life of prayer, meditation, and 
penance. He founded under the rule of St. Benedict an order which takes its 
name from a field owned by Maldule. In a vision, Romuald, while in this field, 
saw a ladder on which monks clothed in white ascended and descended. He 
acquired this field and built the monastery which he called Camaldule.
