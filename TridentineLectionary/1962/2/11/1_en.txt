O God, who by the Immaculate 
Conception of the Virgin didst prepare 
a worthy habitation for Thy Son; we 
humbly beseech Thee, that we who 
celebrate the feast of the Apparition of 
the same holy Virgin, may obtain health
both of soul and body. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
