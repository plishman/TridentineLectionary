May the sacrifice of praise, which we 
offer Thee, O Lord, by the merits of the 
glorious and Immaculate Virgin, rise up 
to heaven as a sweet savor: and may it
obtain for us that physical and moral 
health which we desire. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
