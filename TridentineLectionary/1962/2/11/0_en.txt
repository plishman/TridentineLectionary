I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, 
coming down out of heaven from God, 
made ready as a bride adorned for her 
husband. (Ps 44: 2) My heart 
overflows with a goodly theme; as I 
sing my ode to the King. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. I saw the holy city, New 
Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven
from God, made ready as a bride 
adorned for her husband.
