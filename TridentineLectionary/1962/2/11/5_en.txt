In those days, the angel Gabriel was 
sent from God into a city of Galilee, 
called Nazareth to a virgin espoused to 
a man whose name was Joseph, of the
house of David : and the virgin's name 
was Mary. And the angel being come 
in, said unto her : Hail, full of grace, the
Lord is with thee: blessed art thou 
among women. Who having heard, was
troubled at his saying and thought with 
herself what manner of salutation this 
should be. And the angel said to her: 
Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found 
grace with God. Behold thou shalt 
conceive in thy womb and shalt bring 
forth a Son : and thou shalt call His 
name Jesus.
