Our Blessed Lady appeared to Bernadette Soubirous on February 11, 1858, and
said "I am the Immaculate Conception." Pope Pius X in 1908 ordered that this 
feast be kept in the Universal Church on this day. The miracles at Lourdes have 
continued to the astonishment of the world down to the present time. In 1933 
Bernadette was canonized and her feast fixed on this day.
