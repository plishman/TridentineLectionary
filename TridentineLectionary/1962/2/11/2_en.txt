The temple of God in heaven was 
opened, and there was seen the ark of 
His covenant in His temple, and there 
came flashes of lightning, and peals of 
thunder, and an earthquake, and great 
hail. And a great sign appeared in 
heaven: a women clothed with the sun, 
and the moon was under her feet, and 
upon her head a crown of twelve stars. 
And I heard a loud voice in heaven 
saying, Now has come the salvation, 
and the power of the kingdom of our 
God; and the authority of His Christ.
