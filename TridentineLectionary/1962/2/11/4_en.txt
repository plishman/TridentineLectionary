You are the glory of Jerusalem, you are
the joy of Isrǽl, you are the honor of 
our people. (Song 4: 7) You are all 
beautiful, O Mary, and there is in you 
no stain of original sin. Happy are you, 
O holy Virgin Mary, and most worthy of 
all praise, who with your virgin foot 
have crushed the serpent’s head.
