O God, Who dost gladden us by the 
annual solemnity of Thy martyrs, 
Faustinus and Jovita, mercifully grant 
that we be kindled by the example of 
those in whose merits we rejoice. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
