May Thy saints, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, everywhere make us joyful, that, 
while we venerate their merits, we may
experience their patronage. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(For St. Dorothy, Virgin and Martyr)
Graciously accept the sacrificial gifts 
offered Thee, O Lord, through the 
merits of blessed Dorothy, Thy Virgin 
and Martyr, and grant they may prove 
an unfailing aid for us. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
