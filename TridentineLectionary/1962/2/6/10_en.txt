Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that as we thank You for the 
favors we have received, we may, by 
the intercession of blessed N.,Thy 
Confessor and Bishop, obtain still 
greater blessings. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(For St. Dorothy, Virgin and Martyr)
We who have been refreshed by the 
richness of Thy divine sacrament 
beseech Thee, O Lord our God, that 
through the intercession of blessed 
Dorothy, Thy Virgin and Martyr, we may
forevermore abide in its participation. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
