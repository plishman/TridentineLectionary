O God, who didst adorn blessed Titus, 
Thy confessor and bishop, with 
apostolic virtues; grant that through his 
merits and prayers, we may live justly 
and piously in this world, and thereby 
made worthy to arrive at our heavenly 
country. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(For St. Dorothy, Virgin and Martyr)
May blessed Dorothy, Virgin and 
Martyr, who was ever pleasing to Thee 
by the merit of her chastity and by her 
trust in Thy power, implore for us Thy 
forgiveness, we beseech Thee, O Lord.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
