This feast was instituted in 1882 by Leo XIII, who chose this day because 
January 28, on which date the saint's name appears in the Martyrology, is 
already assigned to another Office. The name of St. Cyril immediately evokes
the memory of those celebrated early sessions of the Council of Ephesus, when,
through the agency of Cyril, the most splendid pages of the doctrine concerning 
the Blessed Virgin Mary were recorded. Nestorius having thrown doubt upon the
dogma that in Jesus Christ there is only one person, it consequently resulted
from this heresy that there could no longer be bestowed upon the Blessed Virgin
the title of Mother of God, by which the faithful until then had been accustomed 
to invoke her. He died A.D. 444.
Commemoration of St. Apollonia: St. Apollonia, a Christian virgin of Alexandria, 
was martyred under the Emperor Decius (249). Because during her martyrdom 
her teeth were broken and torn out, devotion spread to her as a protectress
against toothache. Under divine impulsion she joyfully cast herself into the 
flames prepared for her.
