O God, Who didst render blessed Cyril,
Thy Confessor and Bishop, the 
invincible champion of the divine 
motherhood of the most blessed Virgin 
Mary: grant by his intercession, that we
who believe her to be truly the Mother 
of God, may be saved through her 
maternal intercession. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
