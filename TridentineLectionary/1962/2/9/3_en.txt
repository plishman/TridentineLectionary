(For St. Apollonia)
O God, who among the wonders of Thy
power hast granted even to the weaker 
sex the triumph of martyrdom: 
mercifully grant that we who celebrate 
the heavenly birthday of blessed 
Apollonia Thy Virgin and Martyr may, 
through her example, advance nearer 
to Thee. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
