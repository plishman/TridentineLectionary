At that time, Jesus said to His 
disciples: Do not think that I came to 
send peace upon earth: I came not to 
send peace, but the sword. For I came 
to set a man at variance against his 
father, and the daughter against her 
mother, and the daughter in law 
against her mother in law. And a man's 
enemies shall be they of his own 
household. He that loveth father or 
mother more than Me, is not worthy of 
Me; and he that loveth son or daughter 
more than Me, is not worthy of Me. And
he that taketh not up his cross, and 
followeth Me, is not worthy of Me. He 
that findeth his life, shall lose it: and he 
that shall lose his life for Me, shall find 
it. He that receiveth you, receiveth Me: 
and he that receiveth Me, receiveth 
Him that sent Me. He that receiveth a 
prophet in the name of a prophet, shall 
receive the reward of a prophet: and he
that receiveth a just man in the name of
a just man, shall receive the reward of 
a just man. And whosoever shall give 
to drink to one of these little ones a cup
of cold water only in the name of a 
disciple, amen I say to you, he shall not
lose his reward.
