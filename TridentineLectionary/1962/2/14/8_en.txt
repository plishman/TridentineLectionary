Deign O Lord, we beseech Thee, to 
accept the gifts we offer; and through 
the intercession of Thy blessed Martyr 
Valentine, grant that they may avail as 
a help to our salvation. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
