Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we who keep the birthday of 
blessed Valentine, Thy Martyr, may by 
his intercession be delivered from all 
the ills that threaten us. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
