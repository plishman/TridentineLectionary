Let Thy heavenly mystery, O Lord, 
avail to the restoration of mind and 
body, that, by the intercession of Thy 
blessed Martyr Valentine, we may feel 
the effect of the act which we are 
performing. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
