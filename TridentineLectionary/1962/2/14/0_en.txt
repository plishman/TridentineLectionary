In Thy strength, O Lord, the just man 
shall joy: and in Thy salvation he shall 
rejoice exceedingly: Thou hast given 
him his heart's desire. (Ps. 20: 4) For 
Thou hast prevented him with 
blessings of sweetness: Thou hast set 
on his head a crown of precious 
stones. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. In 
Thy strength, O Lord, the just man shall
joy: and in Thy salvation he shall 
rejoice exceedingly: Thou hast given 
him his heart's desire.
