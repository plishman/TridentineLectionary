St. Andrew, born at Florence of the noble Corsini family, was consecrated at 
birth to the Blessed Virgin. His mother dreamed she had given birth to a wolf, 
which, on entering into the Carmelite Church, was suddenly changed into a 
lamb. As a young man he fell into many sins, but led by divine grace he entered
the Carmelite Order, became its head in Tuscany and later bishop of Fiesole. He
was a model bishop, recognizing that the pastoral office demands not mere 
goodness but an eminent state of sanctity. He died in 1373.
