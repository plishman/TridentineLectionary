O God, Who establish ever new 
examples of virtue in Thy Church, grant
that Thy people may follow the 
footsteps of blessed Andrew, Thy 
Confessor and Bishop, so that they 
may also obtain his reward. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
