St. John of Matha, a Frenchman, with his compatriot, St. Felix of Valois, founded
the Trinitarian Order for the redemption of Christian slaves from the 
Mohammedans. The little cell in which he lived in Rome is still to be seen. On 
the door of the church nearby there still exists, dating from the time of Innocent 
III, a striking mosaic of the Savior between two slaves, one white and the other 
black.
