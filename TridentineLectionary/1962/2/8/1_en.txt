O God, Who didst vouchsafe by 
heavenly direction, through Saint John 
to institute the order of the Most Holy 
Trinity for ransoming captives from the 
power of the Saracens: grant, we 
beseech Thee, that by virtue of his 
merits pleading for us, we may, by 
Thine aid, be delivered from all 
bondage both of body and soul. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
