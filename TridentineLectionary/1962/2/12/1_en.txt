O Lord Jesus Christ Who, in order to 
renew the memory of the sorrows of 
Thy most holy Mother, hast through the
seven blessed fathers enriched Thy 
Church with the new Order of Servites; 
mercifully grant that we may be so 
united in their sorrows as to share in 
their joys. Who lives and reigns with 
God the Father in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
