Let us now praise men of renown, and 
our fathers in their generation. The 
Lord hath wrought great glory through 
His magnificence from the beginning. 
Such as have borne rule in their 
dominions, men of great power and 
endued with their wisdom, showing 
forth in the prophets the dignity of 
prophets, and ruling over the present 
people, and by the strength of wisdom 
instructing the people in most holy 
words. Such as by their skill sought out 
musical tunes, and published canticles 
of the Scriptures. Rich men in virtues, 
lovers of beauty living at peace in their 
houses. All these have gained glory in 
their generations, and were praised in 
their days. They that were born of them
have left a name behind them, that 
their praises might be related. And 
there are some of whom there is no 
memorial; who are perished, as if they 
had never been, and are born as if they
had never been born, and their children
with them. But these were men of 
mercy, whose godly deeds have not 
failed. Good things continue with their 
seed. Their posterity are a holy 
inheritance, and their seed hath stood 
in the covenants. And their children for 
their sakes remain for ever; their seed 
and their glory shall not be forsaken. 
Their bodies are buried in peace, and 
their name liveth unto generation and 
generation. Let the people show forth 
their wisdom, and the Church declare 
their praise.
