Graciously receive, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord, the sacrifice we offer up to 
Thee, and do Thou grant that, through 
the prayers of Thy Saints, being 
inflamed with love for the sorrowing 
Virgin, Mother of Thy Son, we may 
serve Thee with a free mind. Through 
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
