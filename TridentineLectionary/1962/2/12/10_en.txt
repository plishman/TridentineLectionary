Quickened anew by the heavenly 
mysteries, we beseech Thee O Lord, 
that following the example of the saints 
whose feast we are keeping, we may 
steadfastly abide at the foot of the 
cross of Jesus with Mary His mother, 
and merit to partake in the fruits of His 
redemption. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
