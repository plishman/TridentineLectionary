These holy men, canonized by Pope Leo XIII, were Florentine merchants, who 
lived in the Thirteenth Century. They established the Order of the Religious 
Servants of the Holy Virgin, commonly called the Servites, which aimed to 
increase the devotion of Our Lady's Seven Sorrows. Their work was rewarded 
by the conversion of many sinners. They were called Servites by little children
whose innocent lips were miraculously opened on one of the public squares of 
Florence to utter the praises of these seven holy men.
