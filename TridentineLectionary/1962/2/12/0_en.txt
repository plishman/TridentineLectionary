The just sang to Thy holy name, O 
Lord, they praised with one accord Thy 
victorious hand. For wisdom opened 
the mouth of the dumb, and made the 
tongues of infants eloquent. (Ps. 8: 2) 
O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is Thy
name in the whole earth. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. The just sang to Thy holy 
name, O Lord, they praised with one 
accord Thy victorious hand. For 
wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb,
and made the tongues of infants 
eloquent.
