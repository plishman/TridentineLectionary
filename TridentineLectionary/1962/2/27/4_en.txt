Blessed is the man whose help is from 
Thee: in his heart he hath disposed to 
ascend by steps, in the vale of tears, in
the place which he hath set. I have 
chosen to be an abject in the house of 
my God, rather than to dwell in the 
tabernacles of sinners. He will not 
deprive of good things them that walk 
in innocence: O Lord of hosts, blessed 
is the man that trusteth in Thee.
