The eye of God looked upon him for 
good, and He raised him from his 
humility, and exalted his head: and 
many wondered at him, and gave 
honor to God. (Ps. 72: 1) How good is 
God to Israel, to those who are right of 
heart! Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen.
