At that time: They offered to Jesus little
children, that He should touch them. 
But the disciples rebuked them that 
offered them. Whom, when Jesus saw, 
He was angered and said to them: 
Suffer little children to come to Me, and
forbid them not, for of such is the 
Kingdom of God. Amen I say to you, 
whosoever shall not receive the 
kingdom of God as a little child, shall 
not enter into it. And embracing them, 
and laying His hands upon them. He 
blessed them. And when He was gone 
forth into the way, a certain man 
running up and kneeling before Him, 
asked Him, Good Master, what shall I 
do that I may receive life everlasting? 
And Jesus said to him, Why callest 
thou Me good? None is good but one, 
that is God. Thou knowest the 
commandments: Do not commit 
adultery, do not kill, do not steal, bear 
false witness, do no fraud, honor thy 
father and mother. But he answering, 
said to Him: Master, all these things I 
have observed from my youth. And 
Jesus looking on him, loved him, and 
said to him: One thing is wanting unto 
thee: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, 
and give to the poor, and thou shalt 
have treasure in Heaven; and come, 
follow Me.
