The thanks which we offer to Thee, O 
Lord, in the festivity of St. Gabriel, Thy 
confessor, for the gifts we have 
received, do Thou graciously receive at
the hands of the glorious ever-virgin 
Mary: of whom Thou didst take that 
flesh whose sweetness we have 
deserved to taste in this healthful 
banquet. Who lives and reigns with 
God the Father in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
