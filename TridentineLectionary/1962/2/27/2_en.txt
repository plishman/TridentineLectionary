Dearly beloved: I write unto you, young
men because you are strong, and the 
word of God remaineth in you, and you
have overcome the evil. Love not the 
world nor the things that are in the 
world. If any man love the world, the 
charity of the Father is not in him: for all
that is in the world is the 
concupiscence of the flesh and the 
concupiscence of the eyes and the 
pride of life: which is not of the Father, 
but is of the world. And the world 
passeth, and its concupiscence. But he
who doeth the will of God abideth for 
ever.
