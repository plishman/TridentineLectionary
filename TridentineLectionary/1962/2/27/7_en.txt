Make us, O Lord, who offer Thee the 
saving host in memory of St. Gabriel, 
daily to recall the sacrifice of Thy 
death; and by the merits of the 
sorrowful Virgin abundantly to receive 
the fruit of the same sacrifice. Who 
lives and reigns with God the Father in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
