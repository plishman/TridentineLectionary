God, Who didst teach blessed Gabriel, 
diligently to ponder the sorrows of Thy 
most sweet Mother, and Who hast 
gloriously exalted him as a saint and 
worker of wonders: vouchsafe to be 
moved by his merits and prayers, and 
to grant unto us so to mourn with Mary 
Thy Mother, that her maternal care may
ensure our salvation. Who lives and 
reigns with God the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
