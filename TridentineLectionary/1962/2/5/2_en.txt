Brethren: See your vocation, that there 
are not many wise according to the 
flesh, not many mighty, not many 
noble: but the foolish things of the 
world hath God chosen, that He may 
confound the wise, and the weak 
things of the world hath God chosen 
that He may confound the strong; and 
the base things of the world, and the 
things that are contemptible hath God 
chosen, and things that are not, that 
He might bring to nought things that 
are: that no flesh should glory in His 
sight. But of Him are you in Christ 
Jesus, who of God is made unto us 
wisdom, and justice, and sanctification,
and redemption; that as it is written: He
that glorieth may glory in the Lord.
