O God, who among other miracles of 
Thy power, hast granted even to the 
weaker sex the victory of martyrdom, 
grant, we beseech Thee, that we who 
celebrate the festival of blessed 
Agatha, Thy virgin and martyr, may 
walk to Thee by her example. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
