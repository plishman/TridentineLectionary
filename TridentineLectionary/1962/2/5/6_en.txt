At that time, the Pharisees came to 
Jesus tempting Him, and saying: Is it 
lawful for a man to put away his wife 
for every cause? Who answering, said 
to them: Have ye not read, that He who
made man from the beginning, made 
them male and female? And He said: 
For this cause shall a man leave father 
and mother, and cleave to his wife, and
they two shall be in one flesh. 
Therefore now they are not two, but 
one flesh. What therefore God hath 
joined together, let no man put 
asunder. They say to Him: Why then 
did Moses command to give a bill of 
divorce, and to put away? He saith to 
them: Because Moses, by reason of 
the hardness of your heart, permitted 
you to put away your wives; but from 
the beginning it was not so. And I say 
to you, that whosoever shall put away 
his wife, except it be for fornication, 
and shall marry another, committeth 
adultery; and he that shall marry her 
that is put away, committeth adultery. 
His disciples say unto Him: If the case 
of a man with his wife be so, it is not 
expedient to marry. Who said to them: 
All men take not this word, but they to 
whom it is given; for there are eunuchs,
who were born so from their mother's 
womb; and there are eunuchs who 
were made so by man; and there are 
eunuchs who have made themselves 
eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. He
that can take it, let him take it.
