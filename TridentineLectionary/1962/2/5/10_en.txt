May we be helped, O Lord, by the 
mysteries we have received; and 
blessed Agatha, Thy virgin and martyr, 
interceding for us, may they strengthen
us with everlasting protection. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
