Let us all rejoice in the Lord, 
celebrating a festival in honor of 
blessed Agatha, virgin and martyr; at 
whose passion the Angels rejoice, and 
give praise to the Son of God. (Ps 44: 
2) My heart hath uttered a good word; I
speak my words to the King. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Let us all 
rejoice in the Lord, celebrating a 
festival in honor of blessed Agatha, 
virgin and martyr; at whose passion the
Angels rejoice, and give praise to the 
Son of God.
