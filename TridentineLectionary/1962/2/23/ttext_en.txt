This saintly Bishop of Ostia, selected as advisor by seven popes in succession 
was a fearless and distinguished son of the Order of St. Benedict, who, in the 
Eleventh Century, a very turbulent period marked by anti-popes, heresies, and a
lamentable relaxation of the religious spirit, was like a column of fire guiding the 
faithful along the narrow path of the Cross of Christ that leads in safety to 
heaven. He passed from this life to God on February 22, 1072, but because of 
the feast of the Chair of St. Peter, his yearly commemoration takes place on 
this day. Leo XII ordered that his Office - which was at first observed only by the 
Benedictines - should be extended to the Universal Church.
