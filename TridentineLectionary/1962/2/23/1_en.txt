Grant us, we beseech Thee almighty 
God, to follow the admonitions and 
examples of blessed Peter, Thy 
Confessor and Bishop, that by 
contempt of the things of earth we may 
attain to everlasting joys. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
