Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build My Church, and the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against it; and I will 
give to thee the keys of the kingdom of
Heaven. Whatsoever thou shalt bind 
upon earth, it shall be bound also in 
Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt 
loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in
Heaven.
