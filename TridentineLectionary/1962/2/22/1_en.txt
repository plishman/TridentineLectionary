O God, Who, committing to blessed 
Peter, Thine Apostle, the keys of the 
heavenly kingdom, didst bestow on him
the pontifical function of binding and 
loosing, grant that, by the help of his 
intercession, we may be delivered from
the bonds of our sins.
(for St. Paul)
O God, Who by the preaching of the
blessed Apostle Paul didst teach the 
multitude of the Gentiles, grant us, we 
pray Thee, that, honoring his 
commemoration, we may experience 
the benefit of his patronal influence with
Thee.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
