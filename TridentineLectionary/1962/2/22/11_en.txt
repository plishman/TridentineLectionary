Let the gift we offer bring us joy, O 
Lord, that, as we declare Thee 
wonderful in Thine Apostle Peter, so 
through him we may share the 
generosity of Thy forgiveness.
(for St. Paul)
Sanctified by the mystery of salvation, 
O Lord, we pray that his prayer may fail
us not, by whose patronage Thou halt 
granted us to be governed.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
