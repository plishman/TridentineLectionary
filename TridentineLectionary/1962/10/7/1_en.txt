Let us all rejoice in the Lord, 
celebrating a feast in honor of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary: on whose 
solemnity the angels rejoice and join in 
praising the Son of God. (Ps. 44: 2) My 
heart hath uttered a good word; I speak
my works to the King. v. Glory be to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Let us all rejoice in the 
Lord, celebrating a feast in honor of the
Blessed Virgin Mary: on whose 
solemnity the angels rejoice and join in 
praising the Son of God.
God, Whose only-begotten Son, by His 
life, death, and resurrection hath 
purchased for us the rewards of eternal
life: grant, we beseech Thee, that, 
meditating on the mysteries of the most
holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
we may imitate what they contain and 
obtain what they promise. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
