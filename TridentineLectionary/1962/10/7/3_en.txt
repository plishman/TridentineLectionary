The Lord possessed me in the 
beginning of His ways, before He made
anything, from the beginning. I was set 
up from eternity, and of old, before the 
earth was made. The depths were not 
as yet, and I was already conceived. 
Now, therefore, ye children, hear me: 
blessed are they that keep my ways. 
Hear instruction, and be wise, and 
refuse it not. Blessed is the man that 
heareth me, and that watcheth daily at 
my gates; and waiteth at the posts of 
my doors. He that shall find me, shall 
find life, and shall have salvation from 
the Lord.
