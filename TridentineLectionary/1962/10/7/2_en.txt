O eternal Shepherd, do Thou look 
favorably upon Thy flock, which we 
beseech Thee to guard and keep for 
evermore through blessed Mark, 
Supreme Pontiff, whom Thou didst 
choose to be the chief shepherd of the 
whole Church. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
