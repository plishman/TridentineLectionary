Because of truth, and meekness, and 
justice: and thy right hand shall conduct
thee wonderfully. V. Hear, O daughter, 
and see, and incline thine ear; for the 
King hath desired thy beauty. Alleluia, 
alleluia. V. The solemnity of the glorious
Virgin Mary, of the seed of Abraham, 
sprung from the tribe of Juda, of the 
noble line of David. Alleluia.
