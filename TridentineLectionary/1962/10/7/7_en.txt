In Thy loving kindness we beseech 
Thee, O Lord,be moved by the offering
of our gifts and enlighten Thy Church: 
that Thy flock may prosper 
everywhere and the shepherds, under 
Thy guidance, may be rendered 
pleasing to Thy name. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
