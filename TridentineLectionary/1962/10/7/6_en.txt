In me is all grace of the way and of the 
truth; in me is all hope of life and of 
virtue. Like a rose planted on the rivers 
I have borne fruit.
Grant us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, to 
be fittingly prepared for the offering of 
these gifts, and, through the mysteries 
of the most holy Rosary, so to meditate 
upon the life, passion, and glory of 
Thine only-begotten Son that we may 
become worthy of His promises. Who 
liveth and reigneth with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
