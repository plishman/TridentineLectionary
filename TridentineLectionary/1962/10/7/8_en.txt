It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation that we should at all times
and in all places give thanks unto Thee,
O holy Lord, Father almighty, 
everlasting God: and that we should 
praise and bless, and proclaim Thee in 
this feast of the Blessed Virgin Mary, 
ever Virgin: Who also conceived Thine 
only-begotten Son by the 
overshadowing of the Holy Spirit, and 
the glory of her virginity still abiding, 
gave forth to the world the everlasting 
Light, Jesus Christ our Lord. Through 
Whom the Angels praise Thy Majesty, 
the Dominations worship it, the Powers 
stand in awe. The Heavens and the 
Heavenly hosts together with the 
blessed Seraphim in triumphant chorus
unite to celebrate it. Together with them
we entreat Thee, that Thou mayest bid 
our voices also to be admitted, while 
we say in lowly praise:
