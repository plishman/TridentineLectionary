May the annual feast of Saint Anthony, 
Thy Confessor and Bishop, make us in 
Thy kindness acceptable to Thee, O 
Lord: and may this present rite duly 
appease Thee, bring recompense to 
him, and assure gifts of Thy grace to 
us. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
