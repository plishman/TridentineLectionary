Let Thy priests, O Lord, be clothed with
justice, and let Thy Saints rejoice: for 
Thy servant David's sake, turn not 
away the face of Thine Anointed. (Ps. 
131: 1) O Lord, remember David, and 
all his meekness. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Let Thy priests, O Lord, 
be clothed with justice, and let Thy 
Saints rejoice: for Thy servant David's 
sake, turn not away the face of Thine 
Anointed.
