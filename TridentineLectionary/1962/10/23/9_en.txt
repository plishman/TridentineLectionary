O God, the rewarder of faithful souls, 
grant that by the prayers of blessed 
Anthony, Thy Confessor and Bishop, 
whose venerable feast we celebrate we
may obtain pardon. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
