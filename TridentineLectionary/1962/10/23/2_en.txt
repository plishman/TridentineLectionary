Brethren, there were made many 
priests, because by reason of death 
they were not suffered to continue: by 
Jesus, for that He continueth forever, 
hath an everlasting priest hood. 
Whereby He is able to also to save for 
ever them that come to God by Him: 
always living to make intercession for 
us. For it was fitting that we should 
have such a High Priest, holy, innocent,
undefiled, separated from sinners, and 
made higher than the havens: Who 
needeth not daily , as the other priest, 
sins, and then for the people's: for this 
He did once in offering Himself, Jesus 
Christ our Lord.
