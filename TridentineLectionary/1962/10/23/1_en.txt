O God, with the virtues of an apostle 
Thou didst exalt blessed Anthony Mary,
and through him build in Thy Church 
new religious congregations of men 
and women: grant, we pray, that led by 
hid counsels and helped by his prayers,
we may unremittingly work for the 
salvation of souls. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
