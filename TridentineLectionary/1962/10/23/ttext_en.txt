Anthony Mary Claret was a Spanish archbishop and missionary, and was 
confessor of Isabella II of Spain. He founded the congregation of Missionary 
Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, commonly called the Claretians.
Anthony was appointed to head the much-neglected archdiocese of 
Santiago in Cuba. He began its reform by almost ceaseless preaching and 
hearing of confessions, and suffered bitter opposition mainly for opposing 
concubinage and giving instruction to black slaves. A hired assassin—whose 
release from prison Anthony had obtained—slashed open his face and wrist. 
Anthony succeeded in getting the would-be assassin’s death sentence 
commuted to a prison term. Called "the spiritual father of Cuba," he was 
canonized by Pius XII in 1950.
