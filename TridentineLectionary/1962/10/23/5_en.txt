At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
Watch ye therefore, because ye know 
not what hour your Lord will come. But 
know this ye, that if the head man of 
the house knew at what hour the thief 
would come, he would certainly watch, 
and would not suffer his house to be 
broken open. Wherefore be you also 
ready, because at what hour you know 
not the Son of man will come. Who, 
thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise 
servant, whom his lord hath appointed 
over his family, to give them meat in 
season. Blessed is that servant, whom 
when his lord shall come he shall find 
so doing. Amen I say to you, he shall 
place him over all his goods.
