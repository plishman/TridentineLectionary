St. Remigius, who for seventy-four years was Bishop of Rheims, in France, 
converted and baptized King Clovis, and thus brought Christianity to the Franks.
He was celebrated for his doctrine and for his miraculous powers, as well as for 
his holiness. His homilies have been lost, but four of his letters are extant, as 
well as some verses written by him and intended to be engraved on a chalice, 
and also his last testament. He died on January 13, 533.
