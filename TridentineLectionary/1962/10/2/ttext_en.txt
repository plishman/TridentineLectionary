In the prayer for the feast of St. Michael (September 29) we ask that the 
Holy Angels may fulfill the special office entrusted to them of watching faithfully 
over us upon earth. This feast included together with St. Michael the whole of 
the heavenly court. A distinct feast of the Guardian Angels originated only at a
later date. The Spaniards observed it in the Sixteenth Century and Paul V 
(September 27,1608) declared the feast of the Guardian Angels, a feast of the 
whole Church, and ordered that it should be kept on the first vacant date after 
the feast of St. Michael. Clement X (1670) assigned it to October 2nd. Leo XIII 
raised it to the rank of a greater double.
The guardianship of the faithful is given by God into the hands of the angels,
not only for the sake of the unity and harmony which bind together the orders of 
creation, but also on account of the duty owed by the angels to Christ. It Is from 
Christ that they receive their glory, therefore out of gratitude to Him Who is 
caput hominum et angelorum (the head of men and angels) these blessed 
spirits watch over the Church, the chosen Bride of the Savior, and over the 
faithful who are the members of His Mystical Body.
