Receive the gifts, O Lord, which we 
bring in veneration of Thy holy angels, 
and mercifully grant that we be 
delivered by their perpetual guard from 
the perils of this life and at last attain 
unto life everlasting. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
