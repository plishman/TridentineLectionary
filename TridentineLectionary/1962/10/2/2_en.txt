Thus saith the Lord God, Behold I will 
send My angel, who shall go before 
thee, and keep thee in thy journey, and 
bring thee into the place that I have 
prepared. Take notice of him, and hear
his voice, and do not think him one to 
be contemned, for he will not forgive 
when thou hast sinned, and My name 
is in him. But if thou wilt hear his voice, 
and do all that I speak, I will be an 
enemy to Thy enemies, and will afflict 
them that afflict thee: and My angel 
shall go before thee.
