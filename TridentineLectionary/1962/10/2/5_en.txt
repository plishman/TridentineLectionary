At that time the disciples came to 
Jesus, saying, Who, thinkest Thou, is 
the greater in the kingdom of Heaven? 
And Jesus calling unto Him a little child,
set him in the midst of them, and said, 
Amen, I say to you, unless you be 
converted, and become as little 
children, you shall not enter into the 
kingdom of Heaven. Whosoever 
therefore shall humble himself as this 
little child he is the greater in the 
kingdom of Heaven: and he that shall 
receive one such little child in My 
name, receiveth Me; but he that shall 
scandalize one of these little ones that 
believe in Me, it were better for him that
a millstone should be hanged about his
neck, and that he should be drowned in
the depth of the sea. Woe to the world 
because of scandals: for it must needs 
be that scandals come; but 
nevertheless woe to that man by whom
the scandal cometh. And if thy hand, or 
thy foot, scandalize thee, cut it off, and 
cast it from thee. It is better for thee to 
go into life maimed or lame, than 
having two hands or two feet, to be 
cast into everlasting fire. And if thy eye 
scandalize thee, pluck it out, and cast it
from thee. It is better for thee having 
one eye to enter into life, than having 
two eyes to be cast into hell fire. See 
that you despise not one of these little 
ones; for I say to you, that their angels 
in Heaven always see the face of My 
Father Who is in Heaven.
