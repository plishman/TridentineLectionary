O God, Who in Thine ineffable 
providence dost vouchsafe to send 
Thine angels to watch over us, grant to 
Thy suppliants to be continually 
defended by their protection and to 
share their companionship in eternity. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
