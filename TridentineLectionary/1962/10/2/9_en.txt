We have received, O Lord, the divine 
mysteries, rejoicing in the festivity of 
Thy holy angels; we pray that we be 
continually delivered by their protection 
from the snares of our enemies and 
fortified against all adverse powers. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
