May the offerings of thy holy people be 
accepted by Thee, O Lord, in honor of 
Thy saints, through whose merits they 
know that they have received aid in 
time of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(For Sts. Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, 
& Angelus, Martyrs)May this sacrifice that is about to be 
offered cause Thy majesty to be 
appeased toward us, O Lord, by the 
worthy prayer of Thy saints. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
