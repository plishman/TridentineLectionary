Thou hast filled Thy household, O Lord,
with sacred gifts; ever comfort us, we 
beseech Thee, by the intercession of 
the saint whose festival we celebrate. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(For Sts. Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, 
& Angelus, Martyrs)May we be fortified, O Lord, by the 
reception of Thy sacraments, and 
protected, through the intercession of 
Thy holy martyrs, Sergius, Bacchus, 
Marcellus, and Apuleius, by heavenly 
armor against all the malice that 
assaileth us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
