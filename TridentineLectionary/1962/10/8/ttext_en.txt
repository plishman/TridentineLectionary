St. Bridget (or Birgitta) of Sweden, on the death of Prince Ulfo, her husband,
embraced a life of prayer and penance. Favored by Almighty God with 
wonderful visions and revelations, she founded the Religious Order of the Most 
Holy Savior. With her daughter, St. Catherine, she made numerous pilgrimages 
to various sanctuaries in Italy and in Palestine. The secrets of heaven were 
manifested to her in many revelations which are referred to in the Collect of the 
Mass. She exerted her influence in the cause of the Church's reform in the 
courts, episcopal palaces, the abbeys and even at the Holy See. She died at 
Rome, July 2, 1373. Her relics were brought back to Sweden by her daughter a 
year later. She was canonized by Boniface IX, in 1391.
Commemoration of Sts. Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, and Apuleius, 
Martyrs: Sts. Sergius and Bacchus were at one time officers in the imperial 
army. After many tortures they were put to death for being Christians. The date 
of their martyrdom, which took place in the Third Century, is uncertain. Together
with them are honored two Roman martyrs, Marcellus and Apuleius, probably 
their contemporaries.
