O Lord, our God, Who through Thine 
only-begotten Son, didst reveal 
heavenly secrets to blessed Bridget,
grant us, Thy servants, by her
kind intercession, to rejoice and
be glad in the revelation of Thine 
eternal glory. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(For Sts. Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, 
& Angelus, Martyrs)May the blessed merits of Thy holy 
martyrs, Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, 
and Apuleius, bide with us, O Lord, 
and make us ever fervent in Thy love. 
Per Dóminum nostrum Jesum 
Christum, Fílium tuum, qui tecum vivit 
et regnat in unitáte Spíritus Sancti, 
Deus, per ómnia sǽcula sæculórum.
