May the pleading of blessed Francis for
us, as well as the reception of Thy 
Sacraments, protect us, O Lord, that 
we may both share in the glory of his 
works, and receive the help of his 
intercession. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
