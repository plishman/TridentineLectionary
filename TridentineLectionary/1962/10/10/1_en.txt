O Lord Jesus Christ, Who art the model
of true humility and its reward: we 
beseech Thee, that as blessed Francis 
took Thee as model in contemning 
worldly honors and Thou hast glorified 
him: so Thou wouldst associate us with
him both in the contempt and in the 
glory: Who lives and reigns with God 
the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
