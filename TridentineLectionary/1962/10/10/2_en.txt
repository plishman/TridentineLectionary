Beloved of God, and men: whose 
memory is in benediction. He made him
like the saints in glory, and magnified 
him in the fear of his enemies, and with
his words he made prodigies to cease. 
He glorified him in the sight of kings, 
and gave him commandments in the 
sight of his people, and shewed him 
His glory. He sanctified him in his faith, 
and meekness, and chose him out of 
all flesh. For he heard Him, and His 
voice, and brought him into a cloud. 
And He gave him commandments 
before His face, and a law of life and 
instruction.
