Dearly beloved, The ancients therefore 
that are among you, I beseech, who am
myself also an ancient, and a witness 
of the sufferings of Christ: as also a 
partaker of that glory which is to be 
revealed in time to come: feed the flock
of God which is among you, taking care
of it, not by constraint, but willingly, 
according to God: not for filthy lucre's 
sake, but voluntarily: neither as lording 
it over the clergy, but being made a 
pattern of the flock from the heart. And 
when the prince of pastors shall 
appear, you shall receive a never 
fading crown of glory. But the God of all
grace, who hath called us into his 
eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you 
have suffered a little, will himself 
perfect you, and confirm you, and 
establish you. To him be glory and 
empire for ever and ever. Amen.
