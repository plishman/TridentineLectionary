Grant us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
through the intercession of Thy holy 
martyrs Placid and his companions, 
that what we take with the mouth, we 
may receive with a pure heart. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
