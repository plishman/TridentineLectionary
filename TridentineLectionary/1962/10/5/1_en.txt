O God, who dost grant unto us to 
celebrate the heavenly birthday of Thy 
holy Martyrs Placid and his 
companions: grant that we may rejoice 
in their fellowship in everlasting bliss. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
