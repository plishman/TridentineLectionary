Vouchsafe, O Lord, to make the holy 
archangel Raphael our helper, and let 
him whom we believe to be continually 
standing before Thy majesty, present 
our poor prayers to be blessed by 
Thee. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
