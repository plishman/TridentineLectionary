In the Book of Tobias, in the Old Testament, we read of the ministry of the 
holy archangel St. Raphael, protector and guardian of the sick. The Eastern 
Churches observed a feast in his honor since the year 1000. It is now 
universally celebrated throughout the Church. His name signifies "The healing 
of God"; he is one of the seven blessed spirits who always stand before the 
throne of God. He is identified by many Fathers of the Church with the angel 
who stirred the Pool of Bethsaida as related in the Gospel.
