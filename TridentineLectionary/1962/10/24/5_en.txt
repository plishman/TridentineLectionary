At that time, there was a festival day of 
the Jews, and Jesus went up to 
Jerusalem. Now there is at Jerusalem a
pond, called Probatica, which in 
Hebrew is named Bethseda, having 
five porches. In these lay a great 
multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of 
withered, waiting for the moving of the 
water. And an angel of the Lord 
descended at certain times into the 
pond: and the water was moved. And 
he that went down first into the pond 
after the motion of the water, was made
whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay 
under.
