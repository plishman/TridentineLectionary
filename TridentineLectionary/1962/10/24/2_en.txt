In those days, the angel Raphael said 
to Tobias: It is good to hide the secret 
of a king: but honorable to reveal and 
confess the works of God. Prayer is 
good with fasting and alms, more than 
to lay up treasures of gold: for alms 
del√≠vereth from death, and the same is 
that which purgeth away sins, and 
maketh to find mercy and life 
everlasting. But they that commit sin 
and iniquity are enemies to their own 
soul. I discover then the truth unto you, 
and I will not hide the secret from you. 
When thou didst pray with tears, and 
didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy
dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy 
house, and bury them by night, I 
offered thy prayer to the Lord. And 
because thou wert acceptable to God, 
it was necessary that temptation should
prove thee. And now the Lord hath sent
me to heal thee, and to deliver Sara thy
son's wife from the devil. For I am the 
angel Raphael, one of the seven who 
stand before the Lord.
