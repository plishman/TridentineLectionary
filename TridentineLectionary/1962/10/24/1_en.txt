O God, Who to thy servant Tobias 
when on his journey didst give blessed 
Raphael, the archangel, as a 
companion, grant us, Thy servants, that
we may ever be protected by his 
guardianship and strengthened by his 
assistance. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
