We offer Thee sacrifices of praise, O 
Lord, humbly praying that Thou be 
pleased to receive them, through the 
angelic intercession in our behalf, and 
grant that they may avail for, our 
salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
