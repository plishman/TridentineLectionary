Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring 
upon her as it were a river of peace, 
and as an overflowing torrent the glory 
of the gentiles, which you shall suck; 
you shall be carried at the breasts, and 
upon the knees they shall caress you. 
As one whom the mother caresseth, so
will I comfort you, and you shall be 
comforted in Jerusalem. You shall see 
and your heart shall rejoice, and your 
bones shall flourish like an herb, and 
the hand of the Lord shall be known to 
His servants.
