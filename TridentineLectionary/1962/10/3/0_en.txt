Come from Libanus, my spouse, come 
from Libanus, come: Thou hast 
wounded my heart, my sister, my 
spouse: Thou hast wounded my heart. 
(Ps. 112: 1) Praise the Lord, ye 
children: Praise ye the name of the 
Lord. v. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Come from Libanus, my spouse, come 
from Libanus, come: Thou hast 
wounded my heart, my sister, my 
spouse: Thou hast wounded my heart
