We beseech Thee, O Lord, that the 
holy intercession of blessed Teresa, 
Thy virgin, may make our sacrifice 
agreeable to Thee, so that it may be 
made acceptable by the merits of her in
whose honor it is solemnly offered. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
