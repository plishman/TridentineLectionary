O Lord, Who hast said: Unless ye 
become as little children, ye shall not 
enter into the kingdom of Heaven, grant
unto us, we beseech Thee, so to follow 
the footsteps of blessed Teresa, virgin, 
in lowliness and simplicity of heart that 
we may gain everlasting rewards. Who 
lives and reigns with God the Father in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
