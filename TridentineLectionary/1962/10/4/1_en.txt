O God, Who, by the merits of blessed 
Francis, didst increase Thy Church by 
bringing forth a new progeny, grant us 
to imitate him in despising earthly 
things and ever to rejoice in partaking 
of heavenly gifts. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
