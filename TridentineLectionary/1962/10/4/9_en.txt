May heavenly grace, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord. enlarge Thy Church 
which Thou wast pleased to enlighten 
by the glorious merits and examples of 
blessed Francis, Thy confessor. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
