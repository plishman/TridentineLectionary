But God forbid that I should glory, save 
in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
by Whom the world is crucified to me, 
and I to the world. (Ps) I cried to the 
Lord with my voice: with my voice I 
made supplication to the Lord. Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. But God 
forbid that I should glory, save in the 
cross of our Lord Jesus Christ: by 
Whom the world is crucified to me, and 
I to the world.
