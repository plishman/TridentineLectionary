Brethren: But God forbid that I should 
glory, save in the cross of our Lord 
Jesus Christ; by whom the world is 
crucified to me, and I to the world. For 
in Christ Jesus neither circumcision 
availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, 
but a new creature. And whosoever 
shall follow this rule, peace on them, 
and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 
From henceforth let no man be 
troublesome to me; for I bear the marks
of the Lord Jesus in my body. The 
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with 
your spirit, brethren. Amen.
