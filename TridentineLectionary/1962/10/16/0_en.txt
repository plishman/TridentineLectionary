I know, O Lord, that Thy judgments are 
equity, and in Thy truth Thou hast 
humbled me: pierce Thou my flesh with
Thy fear, I am afraid of Thy judgments. 
(Psalms 118: 1) Blessed are the 
undefiled in the way: who walk in the 
law of the Lord. Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now, and 
ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen. I know, O Lord, that Thy 
judgments are equity, and in Thy truth 
Thou hast humbled me: pierce Thou 
my flesh with Thy fear, I am afraid of 
Thy judgments.
