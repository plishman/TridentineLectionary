St. Hedwig, of royal origin, on the death of her husband, Duke Henry of 
Poland, retired into a Cistercian monastery, where she lived under obedience to 
one of her daughters, who was abbess of the monastery, growing day by day in
holiness till Almighty God called her to Himself, October 14, 1243. St. Hedwig 
fasted and prayed and took the discipline; she heard several Masses daily and 
distributed alms with great generosity. She was canonized twenty years later by 
Pope Clement IV.
