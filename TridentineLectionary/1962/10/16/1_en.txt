O God, Who didst teach blessed 
Hedwig to leave the pomp of the world 
for the humble following of Thy cross, 
grant that, through her merits and 
intercession, we may learn to trample 
under foot the perishable delights of 
the world and in the embrace of Thy 
cross to overcome all things that 
oppose us: Who lives and reigns with 
God the Father in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
