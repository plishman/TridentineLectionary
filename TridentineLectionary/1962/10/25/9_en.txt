We have been filled, O Lord, with 
mystic desires and joys; grant, we 
beseech Thee, that, by the intercession
of Thy holy martyrs, Chrysanthus and 
Daria, we may in spirit attain those 
things which in time we celebrate. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
