St. Chrysanthus came with his wife St. Daria from the East to Rome, some 
time in the Third Century. They were accused of being Christians, and after 
suffering many torments their lives were closed by a glorious martyrdom in one 
of the persecutions, probably in that of Valerian, about the year 237. Of them the
Byzantine Liturgy says: "Chrysanthus and Daria live in heaven, though they are 
dead, having been buried alive in one grave. The inseparable pair were 
entombed on March 19."
