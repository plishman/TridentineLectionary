May the prayers of Thy blessed 
martyrs, Chryanthus and Daria, be with
us, O Lord, that we may continually 
experience the loving assistance of 
those to whom we pay homage of 
veneration. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
