May the offering of Thy people, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, be pleasing to
Thee; which is solemnly sacrificed on 
the natal feast of Thy holy martyrs 
Chrysanthus and Daria. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
