At that time, Jesus said to the Scribes 
and Pharisees: Woe to you who build 
the monuments of the prophets: and 
your fathers killed them. Truly you bear 
witness that you consent to the doings 
of your fathers: for they indeed killed 
them, and you build their sepulchres. 
For this cause also the wisdom of God 
said: I will send to them prophets and 
apostles; and some of them they will kill
and persecute. That the blood of all the
prophets which was shed from the 
foundation of the world, may be 
required of this generation, from the 
blood of Abel unto the blood of 
Zacharias, who was slain between the 
altar and the temple: Yea I say to you, it
shall be required of this generation.
