He was the youngest of seven children born to middle-class parents in 
Diecimo (now within the Republic of Lucca). From childhood, he sought solitude 
and wished to dedicate himself to prayer and meditation. At age 17, he began 
his ten-year study to become a certified pharmacist's assistant in Lucca. 
Afterward, he studied for the priesthood and was ordained in 1572. He first 
dedicated himself to the Christian formation of adolescents in his local Lucca 
parish. He also gathered a group of laymen around him to work in hospitals and 
prisons. In 1574 he founded a group charged to deepen Christian faith and 
devotion; this foundation occurred as part of the Counter Reformation. Leonardi 
worked with this group to spread devotion to the Blessed Mother and devotion 
to the Forty Hours as well as spreading the message of the importance of 
frequent reception of Holy Communion.
Commemoration of Sts. Dionysius, Rusticus and Eleutherius, Martyrs:
Ever since the Seventh Century Rusticus and Eleutherius have been associated
with St. Dionyslus (or Denis). The veneration of St. Dionysius at Paris goes back
to an earlier period. St. Gregory of Tours frequently mentions the Basilica of St. 
Denis built at the suggestion of St. Genevieve. This saint, martyred at Paris, is 
to be distinguished from the Areopagite converted by St. Paul, whose 
veneration has ever been famous among the Greeks, and from the pseudo-
Dionysius, a Syrian of the Fifth or Sixth century.
