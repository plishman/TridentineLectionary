By the words of the Lord are His works:
the sun giving light hath looked upon all
things, and full of the glory of the Lord 
is His work. (Ps. 95: 1) O sing unto the 
Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all
the earth. Glory be to the Father, and 
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. By 
the words of the Lord are His works: 
the sun giving light hath looked upon all
things, and full of the glory of the Lord 
is His work.
