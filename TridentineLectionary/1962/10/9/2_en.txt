Brethren. Seeing we have this 
ministration, according as we have 
obtained mercy, we faint not, but 
renounce the hidden things of 
dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, 
nor adulterating the word of God, but 
by manifestation of the truth 
commending ourselves to every man's 
conscience, in the sight of God. And if 
our Gospel be also hid; it is hid to them 
that are lost: in whom the God of this 
world hath blinded the minds of 
unbelievers, that the light of the Gospel
of the glory of Christ, Who is the image 
of God, should not shine unto them. 
For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus
Christ our Lord: and ourselves your 
servants through Jesus. For God, Who 
commanded the light to shine out of 
darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to 
give the light of the knowledge of the 
glory of God, in the face of Christ 
Jesus. For all things are for your sakes:
that the grace, abounding through 
many, may abound in thanksgiving unto
the glory of God. For which cause we 
faint not; but though our outward man 
be corrupted, yet the inward man is 
renewed day by day. For that which is 
at present momentary and light of our 
tribulation, worketh for us above 
measure exceedingly an eternal weight
of glory; while we look, not at the things
which are seen, but at the things which 
are not seen. For the things which are 
seen, are temporal: but the things 
which are not seen, are eternal.
