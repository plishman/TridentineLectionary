Refreshed by the sacred mysteries of 
Thy precious body and blood, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, that, following 
the example of blessed John, Thy 
confessor, we may set ourselves to 
profess that which he believed, and in 
our actions to put into practice that 
which he taught. Who livest and 
reignest, with God the Father, in the 
unity of the Holy Ghost, God, forever 
and ever.
(For St. Dionysius and companions)We who have received Thy 
sacraments, O Lord, beseech Thee 
that, by the intercession of Thy blessed
Martyrs, Dionysius, Rusticus, and 
Eleutherius, we may be profited into the
increase of our everlasting redemption. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
