Let us pray. Receive, O Lord, the clean 
oblation of this salutary sacrifice: and, 
by the intercession of blessed John, 
Thy confessor, grant that everywhere 
among the nations it may fittingly be 
offered up. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(For St. Dionysius and companions)Graciously receive, O Lord we beseech
Thee, the gifts of Thy people in honor 
of Thy saints, and sanctify us by their 
intercession. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
