O God, Who for the propagation of the 
Faith among the people was pleased in
a wondrous manner to stir up blessed 
John, Thy confessor: and Who, through
him, did in Thy Church gather together 
a new Society for the instruction of the 
faithful: do Thou grant unto us Thy 
servants, that we may so profit by his 
teaching, as to attain unto the 
everlasting rewards. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(For St. Dionysius and companions)O God, Who on this day did strengthen 
blessed Dionysius, Thy martyr, with 
the virtue of fortitude in his suffering, 
and did vouchsafe to join with him 
Rusticus and Eleutherius to preach Thy
glory to the nations, grant us, we 
beseech Thee, to imitate them in 
contemning the prosperity of the world 
for the sake of Thy love, and to fear 
none of its adversity. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
