Margaret Mary Alacoque was born at Verosvres in the diocese of Autun in 
1647. When only three years old she already had the greatest fear of the 
smallest sin. Indeed, the very word "sin" frightened her exceedingly. And before 
she was quite four years of age, without anyone suggesting them to her, she 
clearly pronounced the words, "O my God, I consecrate my purity to Thee, for 
my whole life: I vow to Thee perpetual chastity." Even as a mere tot she loved 
Jesus and Mary above all things; and as soon as she had learned to say the 
rosary, she recited it every day. Some time after she had made her First Holy 
Communion, God sent her a grievous sickness that lasted four years. Then 
Margaret had recourse to Our Lady. She promised that if that dear Mother 
would cure her she would become a Sister. Scarcely had she uttered the words 
when she was cured. After some hesitation she entered the Order of the 
Visitation of Paray-Ie-Monial at the age of twenty-three. The Sacred Heart of 
Jesus manifested itself to her several times; through her He willed to make this 
devotion known to the world. She died October 7, 1690.
She was canonized by Pope Benedict XV on Ascension Thursday, May 13, 
1920. Pius XI extended her feast to the whole Church on June 28, 1929.
