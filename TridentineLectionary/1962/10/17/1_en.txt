Lord Jesus Christ, Who didst reveal the
unsearchable riches of Thy Heart to 
blessed Margaret, the virgin, grant us, 
by her merits and our imitation of her 
that, loving Thee in all things and 
above all things, we may deserve to 
have our continual abode in that same 
Heart of Thine. Who lives and reigns 
with God the Father in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
