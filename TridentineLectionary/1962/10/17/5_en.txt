At that time, Jesus answered, and said,
I praise Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven
and earth, because Thou hast hid 
these things from the wise and prudent,
and hast revealed them to little ones. 
Yea, Father; for so it hath seemed good
in Thy sight. All things are delivered to 
Me by My Father; and no one knoweth 
the Son, but the Father; neither doth 
any one know the Father, but the Son, 
and He to Whom it shall please the Son
to reveal Him. Come to Me, all you that 
labor, and are burdened; and I will 
refresh you. Take up My yoke upon 
you, and learn of Me, because I am 
meek, and humble of heart; and you 
shall find rest to your souls: for My yoke
is sweet, and my burden light.
