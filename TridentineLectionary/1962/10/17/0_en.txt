Under the shadow of Him Whom I had 
desired, did I sit: and His fruit was 
sweet to my taste. (Ps. 83: 2-3) How 
lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of 
Hosts! My soul longeth and fainteth for 
the courts of the Lord. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Under the shadow of Him 
Whom I had desired, did I sit: and His 
fruit was sweet to my taste.
