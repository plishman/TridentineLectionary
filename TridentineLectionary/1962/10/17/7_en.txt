May the offerings of Thy people be 
accepted by Thee, O Lord, and grant 
that we be enkindled with that divine 
fire sent forth from the Heart of Thy 
Son, with which blessed Margaret was 
so ardently inflamed. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
