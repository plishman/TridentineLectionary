Having received the mysteries of Thy 
body and blood, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord Jesus, grant us by the 
intercession of blessed Margaret, the 
virgin, that, putting off the proud 
vanities of the world, we may have the 
grace to put on the meekness and 
humility of Thy Heart. Who lives and 
reigns with God the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
