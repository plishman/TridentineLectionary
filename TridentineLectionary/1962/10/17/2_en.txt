Brethren: To me, the least of all the 
Saints, is given the grace to preach 
among the Gentiles the unsearchable 
riches of Christ: and to enlighten all 
men, that they may see what is the 
dispensation of the mystery which hath 
been hidden from eternity in God, Who 
created all things: For this cause I bow
my knees to the Father of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, of Whom all paternity in 
heaven and earth is named, that He 
would grant you according to the riches
of His glory, to be strengthened by His 
Spirit with might unto the inward man, 
that Christ may dwell by faith in your 
hearts: that being rooted and grounded
in charity, you may be able to 
comprehend with all the Saints, what is 
the breadth and length, and height and 
depth: to know also the charity of Christ
which surpasseth all knowledge. That 
you may be filled unto all the fullness of
God.
