May Luke, Thy holy evangelist, O 
Lord, we beseech Thee, intercede in 
our behalf, who for the honor of Thy 
name bore continually in his body the 
mortification of the cross. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
