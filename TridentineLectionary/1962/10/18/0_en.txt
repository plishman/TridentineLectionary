To me thy friends, O God, are made 
exceedingly honorable: their 
principality is exceedingly 
strengthened. (Ps. 138: 1-2) Lord, thou
hast proved me, and known me: thou 
hast known my sitting down and my 
rising up. Glory be to the Father, and 
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. To 
me thy friends, O God, are made 
exceedingly honorable: their 
principality is exceedingly 
strengthened.
