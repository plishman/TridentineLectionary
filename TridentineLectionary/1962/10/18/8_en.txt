It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation, to entreat Thee humbly, 
O Lord, that Thou wouldst not desert 
Thy flock, O everlasting Shepherd, but, 
through Thy blessed Apostles, wouldst 
keep it under Thy constant protection; 
that it may be governed by those same 
rulers, whom as vicars of Thy work, 
Thou didst set over it to be its pastors. 
And therefore with Angels and 
Archangels, with Thrones and 
Dominations, and with all the hosts of 
the heavenly army, we sing the hymn of
Thy glory, evermore saying:
