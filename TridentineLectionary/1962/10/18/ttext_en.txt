St. Luke, a native of Antioch, was converted by St. Paul, and accompanied 
him on many of his journeys. St. Luke is best known as the historian of the New
Testament. He gathered information from the lips of the apostles and wrote, as 
he tells, all things in order. The Acts of the Apostles were written as a sequel to 
his Gospel. He died the death of a martyr, and was buried at Thebes in Breotia. 
His relics were brought to Constantinople in 357.
