Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that what we have received from 
Thy holy altar may, by the prayers of 
Thy blessed evangelist, Luke, sanctify 
our souls, whereby we may be made 
secure. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
