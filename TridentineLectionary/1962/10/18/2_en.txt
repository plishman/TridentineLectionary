Brethren, I give thanks to God, Who 
hath given the same carefulness for 
you in the heart of Titus, for indeed he 
accepted the exhortation; but being 
more careful, of his own will he went 
unto you. We have sent also with him 
the brother, whose praise is in the 
gospel through all the churches; and 
not that only, but he was also ordained 
by the churches companion of our 
travels for this grace, which is 
administered by us to the glory of the 
Lord and our determined will: avoiding 
this, lest any man should blame us in 
this abundance which is administered 
by us; for we forecast what may be 
good, not only before God, but also 
before men. And we have sent with 
them our brother also, whom we have 
proved diligent in many things; but now 
much more diligent, with much 
confidence in you, either for Titus, who 
is my companion and fellow-laborer 
toward you, or our brethren the 
apostles of the churches, the glory of 
Christ. Wherefore show ye to them, in 
the sight of the churches, the evidence 
of your charity, and of our boasting on 
your behalf.
