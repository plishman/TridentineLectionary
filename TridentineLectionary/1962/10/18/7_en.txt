By Thy celestial gifts grant us, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, to serve Thee 
with willing hearts, that the offerings we
bring may, through the intercession of 
blessed Luke, Thine evangelist, 
procure for us both our healing and our 
glory. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
