Lesson from the Epistle of Bl. Paul the 
Apostle to the Corinthians. Brethren, 
he that glory, let him glory in the Lord. 
For not that he that commendeth 
himself is approved, but he whom God 
commendeth. Would to God you could 
bear with some little of my folly, but do 
bear with me. For I am jealous of you 
with the jealousy of God. For I have 
espoused you to one husband, that I 
may present you as a chaste virgin to 
Christ.
