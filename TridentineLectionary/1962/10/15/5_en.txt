At that time, Jesus spoke this parable 
to His disciples, The kingdom of 
Heaven shall be like to ten virgins, who
taking their lamps went out to meet the 
bridegroom and the bride. And five of 
them were foolish, and five wise. But 
the five foolish, having taken their 
lamps, did not take oil with them; but 
the wise took oil in their vessels with 
the lamps. And the bridegroom 
tarrying, they all slumbered and slept. 
And at midnight there was cry made, 
Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye 
forth to meet him. Then all those virgins
arose and trimmed their lamps; and the
foolish said to the wise, Give us of your
oil, for our lamps are gone out. The 
wise answered, saying, Lest perhaps 
there be not enough for us and for you,
go you rather to them that sell, and buy
for yourselves. Now whilst they went to
buy, the bridegroom came, and they 
that were ready went in with him to the 
marriage, and the door was shut. But 
at last came also the other virgins, 
saying Lord, Lord, open to us; but he 
answering said, Amen I say to you, I 
know ye not. Watch ye, therefore, 
because you know not the day nor the 
hour.
