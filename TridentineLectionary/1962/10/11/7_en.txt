Through Thy mercy, O Lord, and the 
intercession of blessed Mary, ever a 
virgin, the Mother of Thine only-
begotten Son, may our oblation profit 
us for eternal and for present prosperity
and peace. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
