Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and 
bear a Son, and His name shall be 
called Emmanuel. (Ps. 97: 1) Sing ye to
the Lord a new canticle: because He 
hath done wonderful things. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Behold, a 
Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, 
and His name shall be called 
Emmanuel.
