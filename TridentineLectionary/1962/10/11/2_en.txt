As the vine I have brought forth a 
pleasant odor, and my flowers are the 
fruit of honor and riches. I am the 
mother of fair love, and of fear, and of 
knowledge, and of holy hope. In me is 
all grace of the way of the truth, in me 
is all hope of life and of virtue. Come 
over to me, all ye that desire me, and 
be filled with my fruits; for my spirit is 
sweet above honey, and my inheritance
above honey and the honeycomb. My 
memory is unto everlasting 
generations. They that eat me, shall yet
hunger; and they that drink me, shall 
yet thirst. He that harkeneth to me shall
not be confounded, and they that work 
by me shall not sin. They that explain 
me shall have life everlasting.
