God, Who wast pleased that at the 
angel's message Thy Word should take
flesh in the womb of the blessed Virgin 
Mary, grant to Thy suppliants that, 
believing her to be truly the mother of 
God, we may be assisted by her 
intercessions with Thee. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
