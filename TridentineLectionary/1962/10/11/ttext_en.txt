In the first ages of the Church the day sacred to our Blessed Lady, under 
her great title of Mother of God, was January 1. Evident traces of this devotion 
remain in the liturgy proper to the feast of the Circumcision, which is now kept 
on that day. Many churches having petitioned for a special festival in honor of 
Our Lady's divine maternity, a day, usually in the month of October, was granted 
by the Holy See for its celebration. By a decree of the Sacred Congregation of 
Rites, April 24, 1914, the eleventh of October was assigned. Pius IX raised it to 
a double of the second class and extended it to the Universal Church.
All Catholics believe that Mary is the Mother of God. This does not mean 
that she is not a creature of God, nor that God did not exist before she was 
created. It means that He who was her Son was a Divine Person. In Christ there
are two natures: the nature of God and the nature of man; but in Him there is 
only one Person, a Divine Person, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity. 
Hence all that may be predicated of either nature may with propriety be said of 
the Savior in the concrete form, without distinguishing the two natures. So we 
may say that God was born of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We then refer to the 
Person of the Son of God, Who is both God and Man. Christ, Who is God, was 
born according to His human nature of the Blessed Virgin. She is, therefore, 
truly the Mother of God.
