May this communion, O Lord, purge 
away our guilt and, by the intercession 
of blessed Mary the Mother of God, 
make us companions of Him, Who is 
our Heavenly healing. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
