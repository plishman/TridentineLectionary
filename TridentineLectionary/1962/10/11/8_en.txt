It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation that we always and 
everywhere give thanks unto Thee, O 
holy Lord, Father almighty, everlasting 
God: and that we should praise and 
bless, and proclaim Thee, in this feast 
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, ever Virgin: 
Who also conceived Thine only-
begotten Son by the overshadowing of 
the Holy Spirit, and the glory of her 
virginity still abiding, gave forth to the 
world the everlasting Light, Jesus 
Christ our Lord. Through whom the 
Angels praise Thy majesty, the 
Dominations adore, the Powers 
tremble: the heavens and the hosts of 
heaven, and the blessed Seraphim, 
together celebrate in exultation. With 
whom, we pray Thee, command that 
our voices of supplication also be 
admitted in confessing Thee saying:
