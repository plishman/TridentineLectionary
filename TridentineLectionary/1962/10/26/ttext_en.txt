Pope St. Evaristus, who succeeded St. Anacletus as Pope, governed the 
Church during nine years. He divided the various ecclesiastical regions of Rome
among the titular presbyters and ordered that seven deacons should surround 
the Pope when he preached. He was put to death for the Faith in the year 112.
