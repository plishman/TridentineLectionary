O God, Who didst vouchsafe to make 
blessed Peter, Thy confessor, glorious 
by the gift of a wonderful spirit of 
penance and most lofty contemplation, 
grant us, we beseech Thee, that, 
through his interceding merits, being 
mortified in the flesh, we may the more
easily understand the things of heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
