Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the offering we humbly bring, 
may both be pleasing to Thee for the 
honor of Thy Saints, and cleanse us 
alike in body and soul. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
