Peter Caravito, or Peter of Alcantara, as he is called from the city of his 
birth, died on October 18, 1562, and his feast was introduced into the Missal by 
Clement X. This saint is distinguished by three characteristics. The first is the 
incredible severity of the mortification by which, like St. Paul, he sought to fill up 
that which was wanting in the Passion of Christ, for the good of the Church. The 
spirit of the Franciscan Reform, initiated in the new so-called province of St. 
Joseph by his endeavors, is one of great penance and extreme poverty. The 
second characteristic of St. Peter of Alcantara is the abundance of mystical gifts 
and the grace of sublime contemplation received by him in reward for his 
austerities. Thirdly, St. Peter is distinguished by the active part he took in the 
reform of the Carmelite Order initiated by St. Teresa. He was the first to examine
and approve of the spirit of this reform. St. Teresa, for her part, declared that 
she had never asked anything of the Lord through the merits of Brother Peter
which she had not obtained.
