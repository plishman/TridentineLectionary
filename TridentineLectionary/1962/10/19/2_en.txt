Brethren: The things that were gain to 
me, these, for the sake of Christ, I have
counted loss. Nay more, I count 
everything loss because of the 
excelling knowledge of Jesus Christ, 
my Lord. For His sake I have suffered 
the loss of all things, and I count them 
as dung that I may gain Christ and be 
found in Him, not having a justice of my
own, which is from the Law, but that 
which is from faith in Christ, the justice 
from God based upon faith; so that I 
may know Him and the power of His 
Resurrection and the fellowship of His 
sufferings: become like to Him in death,
in the hope that somehow I may attain 
to the resurrection from the dead. Not 
that I have already obtained this, or 
already have been made perfect, but I 
press on hoping that I may lay hold of 
that for which Christ Jesus has laid 
hold of me.
