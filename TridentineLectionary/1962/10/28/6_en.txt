Venerating the everlasting glory of Thy 
holy apostles, Simon and Jude, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, that, being 
purified by these sacred mysteries, it 
may the more worthily be celebrated by
us. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
