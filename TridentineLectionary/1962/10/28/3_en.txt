Thou shalt make them princes over all 
the earth: they shall be mindful of Thy 
name, O Lord. Instead of Thy fathers 
sons are born to Thee: therefore shall 
people praise Thee. Alleluia, alleluia. 
(Ps. 138: 17) To me Thy friends, O 
God, are made exceedingly honorable: 
their principality is exceedingly 
strengthened. Alleluia.
