God, Who hast granted us to come to 
the knowledge of Thy name through 
Thy blessed apostles Simon and Jude, 
grant us to celebrate their everlasting 
glory by advancing in knowledge and to
improve by this celebration. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
