St. Simon was a Chananean, and was known among the apostles as "the 
Zealot." Before Christ called him to be an apostle, Simon belonged to the 
patriotic party known as Zealots, who, impatient of foreign rule, prepared for a 
war of independence. This circumstance was not forgotten, and even after he 
had become a disciple of the Lord, he was still known by the appellation of the 
Zealot. He suffered martyrdom in Persia, according to tradition.
St. Jude is the brother of James the Less, first bishop of Jerusalem, and 
therefore a cousin of Our Savior. The New Testament includes a short letter 
written by St. Jude, who is daily commemorated in the Roman Canon of the 
Mass under the name of Thaddeus. It is believed that the relics of these two 
apostles are in St. Peter's in Rome. Tradition says that he preached in 
Mesopotamia, where he died for the Faith. He is the patron of difficult cases.
