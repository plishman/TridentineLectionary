At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
These things I command you, that you 
love one another. If the world hate you, 
know ye that it hath hated Me before 
you. If you had been of the world, the 
world would love its own; but because 
you are not of the world, but I have 
chosen you out of the world, therefore 
the world hateth you. Remember My 
word that I said to you, The servant is 
not greater than his master. If they 
have persecuted Me, they will also 
persecute you: If they have kept My 
word, they will keep yours also. But all 
these things they will do to you for My 
name's sake, because they know not 
Him that sent Me. If I had not come, 
and spoken to them, they would not 
have sin; but now they have no excuse 
for their sin. He that hateth Me, hateth 
My Father also. If I had not done 
among them the works that no other 
man hath done, they would not have 
sin; but now they have both seen and 
hated both Me and My Father. But that 
the word may be fulfilled which is 
written in their law, They hated Me 
without cause.
