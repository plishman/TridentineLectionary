Having received Thy sacraments, we 
beseech and supplicate Thee, O Lord, 
that, by the intercession of Thy blessed
apostles Simon and Jude, the things 
which we do for the veneration of their 
glory may profit us unto our healing. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
