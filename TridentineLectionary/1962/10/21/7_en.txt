After her shall virgins be brought to the 
King: her neighbors shall be brought to 
Thee with gladness and rejoicing: they 
shall be brought into the temple of the 
King, the Lord.
Favorably look down, we beseech 
Thee, upon the gifts laid upon Thine 
altars, O Lord, for the festival of Thy 
holy virgins and martyrs, Ursula and 
her companions, that, as Thou hast 
conferred glory upon them through 
these blessed mysteries, so Thou 
mayest bestow upon us forgiveness. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
