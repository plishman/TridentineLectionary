May the intercession of blessed 
Hilarion the Abbot commend us unto 
Thee, we beseech Thee, O Lord: so 
that what we cannot acquire by any 
merits of ours, we may obtain by his 
patronage. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
