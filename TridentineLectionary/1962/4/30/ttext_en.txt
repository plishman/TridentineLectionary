St. Catharine of Siena was the twenty-third in a family of twenty-four 
children. She is best known for the work she did in persuading Gregory XI in 
bringing the Papacy from Avignon back to Rome. She worked miracles for the 
sake of the poor and the afflicted. At the age of eighteen she received the habit 
of the Third Order of St. Dominic. For three years she never spoke to anyone 
but God and her confessor. During her prolonged fast her only food was Holy 
Communion. Our Savior appearing to her on one occasion offered her a crown 
of thorns and another of roses, bidding her choose; she eagerly took the crown 
of thorns and forcibly pressed it upon her head. She died in 1380.
