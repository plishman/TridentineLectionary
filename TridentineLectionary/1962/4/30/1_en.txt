Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we, who venerate the natal 
feast of blessed Catherine, Thy virgin, 
may be both gladdened by her annual 
solemnity and helped by the example 
of so great virtue. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
