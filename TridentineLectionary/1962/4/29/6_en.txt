Graciously regard, O Lord, the prayers,
we offer thee, through the intercession 
of blessed Peter, thy Martyr; and keep 
ever under thy protection the 
champions of the faith. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
