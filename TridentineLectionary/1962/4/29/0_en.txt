Thou hast protected me, O God, from 
the assembly of the malignant, alleluia: 
from the multitude of the workers of 
iniquity, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 63: 2) 
Hear, O God, my prayers, when I make
supplication to Thee: deliver my soul 
from the fear of the enemy. Glory be to
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. Thou hast protected me, O
God, from the assembly of the 
malignant, alleluia: from the multitude 
of the workers of iniquity, alleluia. 
alleluia.
