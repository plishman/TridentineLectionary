At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
I am the true Vine; and My Father is the
husbandman. Every branch in Me, that 
beareth not fruit, He will take away: and
every one that beareth fruit, He will 
purge it, that it may bring forth more 
fruit. Now you are clean by reason of 
the word, which I have spoken to you. 
Abide in Me, and I in you. As the 
branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless
it abide in the vine, so neither can you, 
unless you abide in Me. I am the Vine: 
you the branches: he that abideth in 
Me, and I in him, the same beareth 
much fruit: for without Me you can do 
nothing. If any one abide not in Me, he 
shall be cast forth as a branch, and 
shall wither, and they shall gather him 
up, and cast him into the fire, and he 
burneth. If you abide in Me, and my 
words abide in you, you shall ask 
whatever you will, and it shall be done 
unto you.
