St. Peter was a Dominican priest of unspotted life, who labored earnestly for
the conversion of heretics. In the end he was cruelly killed near Como, in Italy, 
April 6, 1252. He was the object of widespread veneration in Italy during the 
Fifteenth Century. In his day, heresy was a crime against the state and 
punished by civil authority. St. Peter, as inquisitor, was thus able to protect the 
Faith and to save the state from revolution.
