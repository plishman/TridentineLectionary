Grant us grace, we beseech thee, O 
Almighty God, to follow with zeal 
conformable thereto after the pattern of
that great example of faith, thy blessed 
Martyr Peter, who, for the spreading of 
the same faith, did so run as to obtain 
the palm of martyrdom. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
