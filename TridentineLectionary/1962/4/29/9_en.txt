May the Sacrament, O Lord, which we, 
the faithful people have received, hold 
us in safe keeping, and through the 
intercession of thy blessed Martyr Peter
defend us from all assaults of the 
enemy. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
