Beloved: Be mindful that the Lord 
Jesus Christ is risen again from the 
dead, of the seed of David, according 
to my gospel. Wherein I labor even 
unto bands, as an evildoer; but the 
word of God is not bound. Therefore I 
endure all things for the sake of the 
elect, that they also may obtain the 
salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with 
heavenly glory. But thou hast fully 
known my doctrine, manner of life, 
purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, 
patience, Persecutions, afflictions: such
as came upon me at Antioch, at 
Iconium, and at Lystra: what 
persecutions I endured, and out of 
them all the Lord delivered me. And all 
that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall 
suffer persecution.
