O God, the Creator and Redeemer of 
all the faithful: grant unto the souls of 
Thy servants and handmaidens the 
remission of all their sins: that through 
devout supplications, they may obtain 
the pardon which they have ever 
desired. Who lives and reigns with God
the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
