The Requiem Mass pre-dates the Mass of Pius V and represents a simpler, less
ornamented form than what we commonly call the "Traditional Latin Mass." 
Psalm 42 is not present in the Prayers at the Foot. The Gloria and Credo are 
not said. The Gloria Patri… is not found anywhere in the Mass.
The liturgical color is black, because we mourn our loss and pray for the 
Dead, whose fate is not known to us.
Many blessings and Signs of the Cross are absent: for instance, the priest 
does not sign himself at the Introit; before the Gospel he does not ask for God’s 
blessing nor after does he request that our sins be erased by the words of the 
Gospel; there is no blessing of the water (representing humanity) before it is 
combined in the chalice with the wine (representing divinity); there is no final 
blessing of the people, etc.
What is present is the magnificent Sequence, the Dies Irae, one of the 
greatest poems in the Latin language, and certainly the greatest poem about 
man’s need for mercy in the face of final judgment. The Agnus Dei pleads for 
the Lamb to "grant them eternal rest" rather than "have mercy on us." Similarly, 
rather than bless us at the end of Mass, the Requiem implores God to "grant 
them rest."
