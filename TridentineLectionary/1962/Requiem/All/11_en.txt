May the prayers of Thy suppliant 
people, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
avail for the souls of Thy servants and 
handmaids: that Thou mayest both 
deliver them from all their sins and 
make them to be sharers in Thy 
Redemption. Who lives and reigns with 
God the Father in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
