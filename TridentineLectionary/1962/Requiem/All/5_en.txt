Day of wrath, that day of mourning,
Lo, the world in ashes burning,
Seer and David gave the warning,
<br>
O what fear man's bosom rendeth,
When from heaven the Judge 
descendeth,
On whose sentence all dependeth.
<br>
Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth,
Through earth's sepulchres it ringeth,
All before the throne it bringeth.
<br>
Death is struck, and nature quaking,
All creation is awaking,
To its Judge an answer making.
<br>
Lo, the book exactly worded,
Wherein all hath been recorded,
Thence shall judgment be awarded.
<br>
When the Judge His seat attaineth,
And each hidden deed arraigneth,
Nothing unavenged remaineth.
<br>
What shall I, frail man, be pleading?
Who for me be interceding
When the just are mercy needing?
<br>
King of majesty tremendous,
Who dost free salvation send us,
Fount of pity, then befriend us.
<br>
Think, kind Jesus, my salvation
Caused Thy wondrous Incarnation.
Leave me not to reprobation.
<br>
Faint and weary Thou hast sought me,
On the cross of suffering bought me,
Shall such grace be vainly brought me?
<br>
Righteous Judge of retribution,
Grant Thy gift of absolution,
Ere that reck’ning day’s conclusion.
<br>
Guilty now I pour my moaning,
All my shame with anguish owning,
Spare, O God, Thy suppliant groaning.
<br>
Thou the sinful Mary savest,
Thou the dying thief forgavest,
And to me a hope vouchsafest.
<br>
Worthless are my prayers and sighing,
Yet, good Lord, in grace complying,
Rescue me from fires undying.
<br>
With Thy favored sheep O place me,
Nor among the goats abase me,
But to Thy right hand upraise me.
<br>
When the wicked are confounded,
Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,
Call me with Thy Saints surrounded.
<br>
Low I kneel with heart's submission,
See, like ashes, my contrition,
Help me in my last condition.
<br>
Ah! That day of tears and mourning,
From the dust of earth returning,
<br>
Man for judgment must prepare him,
Spare, O God, in mercy spare him.
<br>
Lord, all pitying, Jesu blest,
Grant them Thine eternal rest. Amen.
