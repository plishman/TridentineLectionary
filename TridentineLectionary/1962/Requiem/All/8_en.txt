Mercifully regard, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, the Sacrifice for the souls of Thy 
servants and handmaidens: that to 
those to whom Thou didst grant the 
favor of the Christian Faith Thou 
wouldst also grant due reward. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
