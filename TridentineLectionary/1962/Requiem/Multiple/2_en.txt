In those days, the most valiant man 
Judas, making a gathering, sent 
twelve thousand drachmas of sllver to 
Jerusalm for sacrifice to be offered for 
the sins of the dead, thinking well and 
religiously concerning the resurrection 
(for if he had not hoped that they that 
were slain should rise again, it would 
have seemed superfluous and vain to 
pray for the dead); and because he 
considered that they who had fallen 
asleep with godliness had great grace 
laid up for them. It is therefore a holy 
and wholesome thought to pray for the 
dead, that they may be loosed from 
sins.
