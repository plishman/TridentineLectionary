Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, that 
the souls of Thy servants and 
handmaids, the anniversary of whose 
burial we commemorate, may be 
purged by this sacrifice and obtain alike
forgiveness and everlasting rest. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
