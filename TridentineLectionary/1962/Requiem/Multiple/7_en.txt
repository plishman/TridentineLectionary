O Lord Jesus Christ, King of glory, 
deliver the souls of all the faithful 
departed from the pains of hell and 
from the deep pit; deliver them from the
lion's mouth, that hell engulf them not, 
nor they fall into darkness, but let 
Michael, the holy standard-bearer, 
bring them into the holy light which 
Thou once didst promise to Abraham 
and his seed. V. We offer Thee, O Lord,
sacrifices and prayers of praise; do 
Thou accept them for those souls 
whom we this day commemorate; grant
them, O Lord, to pass from death to the
life which Thou once didst promise to 
Abraham and his seed.
