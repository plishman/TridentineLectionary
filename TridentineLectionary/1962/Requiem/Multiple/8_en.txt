Be propitiated, O Lord, by our 
supplications for the souls of Thy 
servants and handmaids, whose 
anniversary is kept today, for whom we 
offer Thee the sacrifice of praise, that 
Thou vouchsafe to join them to the 
company of Thy saints. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
