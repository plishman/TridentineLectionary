Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord; 
and let perpetual light shine upon them.
(Ps. 64: 2,3) A hymn, O God, becometh
Thee in Sion; and a vow shall be paid 
to Thee in Jerusalem: O Lord, hear my 
prayer; all flesh shall come to Thee. 
Eternal rest give to them, O Lord; and 
let perpetual light shine upon them.
