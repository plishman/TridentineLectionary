O God, the Lord of mercies, grant to 
the souls of Thy servants and 
handmaids, the anniversary of whose 
burial we commemorate, an abode of 
refreshment. the beatitude of rest, and 
the brightness of light. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
