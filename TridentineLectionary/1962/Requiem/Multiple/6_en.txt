At that time, Jesus said to the 
multitudes of the Jews, All that the 
Father giveth Me shall come to Me: 
and him that cometh to Me I will not 
cast out: because I came down from 
heaven, not to do My own will, but the 
will of Him Who sent Me. Now this is 
the will of the Father Who sent Me, that
of all that He hath given Me, I should 
lose nothing, but should raise it up 
again in the last day; and this is the will
at My Father that sent Me, that every 
one who seeth the Son, and believeth 
in Him, may have life everlasting; and I 
will raise him up in the last day.
