The former treatise I made, O 
Theophilus, of all things which Jesus 
began to do and to teach, until the day 
on which, giving commandments by the
Holy Spirit to the Apostles whom He 
had chosen, He was taken up: to whom
also He showed Himself alive after His 
Passion by many proofs, for forty days 
appearing to them and speaking of the 
Kingdom of God. And eating together 
with them, He commanded them that 
they should not depart from Jerusalem,
but should wait for the promise of the 
Father, which you have heard (saith 
He), by My mouth; for John indeed 
baptized with water, but you shall be 
baptized with the Holy Spirit not many 
days hence. They therefore who were 
come together asked Him, saying: 
Lord, wilt Thou at this time restore 
again the kingdom of Israel? But He 
said to them: It is not for you to know 
the times or moments which the Father 
hath put in His own power: but you 
shall receive the power of the Holy 
Spirit coming upon you, and you shall 
be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, 
and in all Judea and Samaria, and 
even to the uttermost part of the earth. 
And when He had said these things, 
while they looked on, He was raised 
up: and a cloud received Him out of 
their sight. And while they were 
beholding Him going up to heaven, 
behold two men stood by them in white 
garments, who also said: Ye men of 
Galilee, why stand you looking up to 
heaven? This Jesus, who is taken up 
from you into heaven, shall so come as
you have seen Him going into heaven.
