The liturgical festival of the Ascension, while less ancient than that of 
Pentecost, is one of the oldest of the cycle, and was already so universally 
observed that St. Augustine was able to attribute its institution to the Apostles 
themselves.
At Rome, the Pope, after the night Office was concluded, and after Mass
had been celebrated at the altar of St. Peter, was crowned by the cardinals, and 
towards the sixth hour was accompanied by bishops and clergy to the Lateran.
On this day Jesus was taken up into heaven; His faithful disciples continued
to gaze heavenward. The contemplative vision of Paradise is reserved, 
however, for those who have already passed into the Church Triumphant.
The supreme glorification of the Head, Who is this day enthroned at the 
right hand of the Father in heaven, affects the members also, like the precious 
balsam which, as the psalmist tells us, descended from the head of Aaron on to 
his flowing beard and on to his gorgeous pontifical vestments. This spiritual 
unction is the gift of the Holy Ghost, which Christ obtains today from heaven for 
his Church. Hence the connection between the Ascension and Pentecost is very
close, nor can we understand the one without the other.
