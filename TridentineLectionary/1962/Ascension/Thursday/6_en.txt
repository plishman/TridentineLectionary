Receive, O Lord: the gifts we offer up 
to Thee, for the glorious Ascension of 
Thy Son: and mercifully grant that we 
may be freed from present perils and 
attain unto everlasting life. Through the
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
