Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God: that we, who believe Thine only-
begotten Son, our Redeemer, to have 
ascended on this day into heaven, may
also ourselves dwell in mind amid 
heavenly things. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
