At that time Jesus appeared to the 
eleven as they were at table: and He 
upbraided them with their incredulity 
and hardness of heart, because they 
did not believe them who had seen Him
after He was risen again. And He said 
to them: Go ye into the whole world 
and preach the Gospel to every 
creature. He that believeth and is 
baptized shall be saved: but he that 
believeth not shall be condemned. And 
these signs shall follow them that 
believe: In My name they shall cast out 
devils; they shall speak with new 
tongues; they shall take up serpents 
and if they shall drink any deadly thing, 
it shall not hurt them; they shall lay their
hands upon the sick, and they shall 
recover. And the Lord Jesus, after He 
had spoken to them, was taken up into 
heaven and sitteth on the right hand of 
God. But they going forth preached 
everywhere, the Lord working withal, 
and confirming the word with signs that 
followed.
