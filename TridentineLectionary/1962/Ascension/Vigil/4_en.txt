At that time, Jesus lifting up His eyes to
heaven said: Father, the hour has 
come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son 
may glorify Thee, as Thou hast given 
Him power over all flesh, that He may 
give eternal life to all whom Thou hast 
given Him. Now this is eternal life: that 
they may know Thee, the only true 
God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast
sent. I have glorified Thee on the earth;
I have finished the work which Thou 
gavest Me to do; and now glorify Thou 
Me, O Father, with Thyself, with the 
glory which I had, before the world was,
with Thee. I have manifested Thy name
to the men whom Thou hast given Me 
out of the world. Thine they were, and 
to Me Thou givest them, and they have 
kept Thy word. Now they have known 
that all things which Thou hast given 
Me are from Thee: because the words 
which Thou gavest Me, I have given to 
them: and they have received them, 
and have known in very deed that I 
came out from Thee, and they have 
believed that Thou didst send Me. I 
pray for them; I pray not for the world, 
but for them whom Thou hast given 
Me; because they are Thine: and all My
things are Thine, and Thine are Mine: 
and I am glorified in them. And now I 
am not in the world, and these are in 
the world, and I come to Thee.
