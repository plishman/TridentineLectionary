Declare it with the voice of joy, and 
make it known, alleluia: declare it even 
to the ends of the earth: The Lord hath 
delivered His people, alleluia, alleluia. 
(Ps. 65: 1-2) Shout with joy to God, all 
the earth, sing ye a psalm to His name:
give glory to His praise. Glory be to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Declare it with the voice of
joy, and make it known, alleluia: 
declare it even to the ends of the earth:
The Lord hath delivered His people, 
alleluia, alleluia.
