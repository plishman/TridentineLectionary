Ye men of Galilee, why wonder you, 
looking up to Heaven? Alleluia. He shall
so come as you have seen Him going 
up into Heaven, alleluia, alleluia, 
alleluia. (Ps. 46: 2) O clap your hands, 
all ye nations shout unto God, with the 
voice of exultation. Glory be to the 
Father and to the Son and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now
and ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen. Ye men of Galilee, why wonder 
you, looking up to Heaven? Alleluia. He
shall so come as you have seen Him 
going up into Heaven, alleluia, alleluia, 
alleluia.
