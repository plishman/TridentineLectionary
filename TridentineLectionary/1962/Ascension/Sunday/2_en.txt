Dearly beloved, be prudent, and watch 
in prayers. But before all things have a 
constant mutual charity among 
yourselves; for charity covereth a 
multitude of sins. Using hospitality one 
toward another, without murmuring: as 
every man hath received grace, 
ministering the same one to another; as
good stewards of the manifold grace of 
God. If any man speak, let him speak 
as the words of God. If any man 
minister, let him do it as of the power 
which God administereth; that in all 
things God may be honored through 
Jesus Christ, our Lord.
