Hear, O Lord, my voice with which I 
have cried to Thee, alleluia. My heart 
hath said to Thee, l have sought Thy 
face, Thy face, O Lord, I will seek: turn 
not away Thy face from me, alleluia, 
alleluia. (Ps. 26: 1) The Lord is my light,
and my salvation: whom shall I fear? 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Hear, O 
Lord, my voice with which I have cried 
to Thee, alleluia. My heart hath said to 
Thee, l have sought Thy face, Thy face,
O Lord, I will seek: turn not away Thy 
face from me, alleluia, alleluia.
