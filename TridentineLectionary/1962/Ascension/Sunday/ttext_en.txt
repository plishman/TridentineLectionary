On this day when the Pope celebrated Mass at Sancta Maria rotunda, 
formerly the Pantheon, he preached about the coming of the Holy Ghost; to 
illustrate his words, a shower of roses in figura ejusdem Spiritus Sancti (as a 
figure of the same Holy Spirit) was scattered from the central opening in the roof
upon the people as he preached.
