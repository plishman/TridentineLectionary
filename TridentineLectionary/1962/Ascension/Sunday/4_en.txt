At that time Jesus said to His disciples: 
When the Paraclete cometh, Whom I 
will send you from the Father, the Spirit 
of truth, Who proceedeth from the 
Father, He shall give testimony of Me: 
and you shall give testimony, because 
you are with Me from the beginning. 
These things have I spoken to you, that
you may not be scandalized. They will 
put you out of the synagogues: yea, the
hour cometh, that whosoever killeth 
you will think that he doth a service to 
God. And these things will they do to 
you, because they have not known the 
Father, nor Me. But these things I have 
told you, that, when the hour shall 
come, you may remember that I told 
you.
