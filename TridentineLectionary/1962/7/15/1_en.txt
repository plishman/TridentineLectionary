O God, Who on this day didst remove 
blessed Henry, Thy confessor, from the
crown of an earthly empire to an 
everlasting kingdom, we humbly 
beseech Thee that, as, protected by 
the abundance of Thy grace, Thou 
didst enable him to overcome the 
temptations of the world, so Thou make
us, in imitation of him, to avoid the 
allurements of this world and to come 
with pure minds unto Thee Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
