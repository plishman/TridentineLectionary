At that time, Jesus said to His disciples,
Let your loins be girt, and lamps 
burning in your hands. And you 
yourselves like to men who wait for 
their lord, when he shall return from the
wedding; that when he cometh and 
knocketh, they may open to him 
immediately. Blessed are those 
servants, whom the Lord when he 
cometh, shall find watching. Amen I say
to you, that he will gird himself, and 
make them sit down to meat, and 
passing will minister unto them. And if 
he shall come in the second watch, or 
come in the third watch, and find them 
so, blessed are those servants. But this
know ye, that if the householder did 
know at what hour the thief would 
come, he would surely watch, and 
would not suffer his house to be broken
open. Be you then also ready: for at 
what hour you think not, the Son of 
man will come.
