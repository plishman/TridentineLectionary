The name of St. Henry, Emperor of Germany, born in 972, is held in veneration 
by all. He spread Christianity and advanced piety and religion among his 
subjects. He died in 1024. He defended the Church and the Holy See. He came 
down repeatedly into Italy in order to defend the rightful Pontiff against opposing
factions. Detained at Monte Cassino by illness he was miraculously cured 
through the intercession of St. Benedict. He asked to be accepted as a monk in 
the Abbey of St. Vanne at Verdun; the abbot commanded him, in the name of 
religious obedience to re-ascend the throne. He spent a great part of his 
treasure in founding episcopal sees, enriching churches, and endowing 
monasteries. On one occasion he sent his imperial insignia to the Abbey of 
Cluny in order that they should be offered up to the Redeemer. St. Henry died 
on July 13, 1024, and was canonized by Pope Eugenius III in 1145.
