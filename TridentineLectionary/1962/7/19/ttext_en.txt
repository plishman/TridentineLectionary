St. Vincent de Paul, founder of the Congregation of the Priests of the 
Mission (Lazarists), and the Society of the Sisters of Charity, while a young 
priest was held as a slave in Africa where he had been sold by pirates. On his 
return to France he became a parish priest. For a time he took the place of a 
galley slave. His parish was a country parish; his experience led him to found 
the Priests of the Mission, bound by special vow to undertake this special work. 
At one time he was entrusted by St. Francis de Sales with the spiritual direction 
of the nuns of the Visitation. Assisted by Louise de Marillac he founded the 
Sisters of Charity. The authority exercised by St. Vincent was immense, and 
was undisputed throughout the kingdom. He was a member of the king's Privy 
Council, and thus had control over the appointments to the episcopal sees and 
to the richest benefices of the Church of France. Yet Vincent, meek and humble 
of heart, ascended the magnificent stairs of the palace and took part in the 
royal councils with the same evangelical simplicity, and clothed in the same poor
and shabby garments in which he traversed the streets of Paris rescuing 
abandoned waifs and strays and succoring the helpless sick and suffering. He 
died in 1660 at St. Lazarus, the motherhouse of his Congregation. Leo XIII 
declared him the patron of all charitable associations.
