O God, Who endowed St. Vincent with 
apostolic strength to preach the Gospel
to the poor and to enhance the dignity 
of clerical life; grant, we beseech Thee,
that we who honor his holy merits may 
also conform to the example of his 
virtues. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, who liveth and reigneth with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
