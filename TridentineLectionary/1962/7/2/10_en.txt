We have received, O Lord, the votive 
sacrament of this annual solemnity; 
grant, we beseech Thee, that it may 
afford us a remedy both for temporal 
and for eternal life. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Processus & 
Martinianus, Martyrs)Filled with the offering of Thy sacred 
Body and Thy precious Blood, we 
beseech Thee O Lord, our God, that 
what we do in pious devotion may 
assure us of redemption. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
