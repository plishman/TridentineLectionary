Let the humanity of Thine only-
begotten Son succor us, O Lord, that 
He, Who born of a virgin, did not 
diminish, but consecrated, the virginity 
of His mother, may on this solemn 
festival of her visitation, deliver us from 
our sins and make our offering 
acceptable, even Jesus Christ our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Processus & 
Martinianus, Martyrs)Receive, O Lord, our prayers and 
offerings, and, that they may be worthy 
in Thy sight, may we be assisted by the
prayers of Thy saints. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
