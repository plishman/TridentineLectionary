Ember Friday in Advent was the original date for this feast. The celebration 
by the Greeks on July 2 of the placing of the robe of the Blessed Virgin in the 
Basilica of Blachernae (A.D. 469) became in the Latin church the 
commemoration of the visit of Mary to the home of Zarchary and Elizabeth. It 
was kept by the Franciscans as early as 1263; the Council of Basel (1431) 
made it a holy day of obligation. In honor of this mystery, St. Francis de Sales 
instituted the order of the nuns of the Visitation.
Commemoration: Sts. Processus and Martinian were the keepers of the 
Mamertine prison, during the imprisonment of Sts. Peter and Paul, by whom 
they were converted. Like them they suffered martyrdom under Emperor Nero. 
Their relics now repose in St. Peter's; during the First Vatican Council the papal 
throne occupied by Pius IX stood at the tomb of these two gaolers of the Princes
of the Apostles.
