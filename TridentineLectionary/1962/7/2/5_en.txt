At that time Mary rising up went into the
hill country with haste into a city of 
Juda: and she entered into the house 
of Zachary, and saluted Elizabeth. And 
it came to pass, that when Elizabeth 
head the salutation of Mary, the infant 
leaped in her womb: and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Ghost: and she cried
out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed
art thou among women and blessed is 
the fruit of thy womb. And whence is 
this to me, that the mother of my Lord 
should come to me? For behold as 
soon as the voice of thy salutation 
sounded in my ears, the infant in my 
womb leaped for joy. And blessed art 
thou that hast believed, because those 
things shall be accomplished that were 
spoken to thee by the Lord. And Mary 
saith: My soul doth magnify the Lord: 
and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my 
Savior.
