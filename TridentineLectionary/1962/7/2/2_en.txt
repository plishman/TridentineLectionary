Behold He cometh, leaping over the 
hills. My beloved is like a roe or a 
young hart. Behold He standeth behind
our wall; looking through the windows, 
looking through the lattices. Behold my 
beloved speaketh to me, Arise, make 
haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful 
one; and come. For winter is now past, 
the rain is over and gone. The flowers 
have appeared in our land, the time of 
pruning is come, the voice of the turtle 
is heard in our land; the fig tree hath 
put forth her green figs, the vines in 
flower yield their sweet smell. Arise, my
love, my beautiful one, and come, My 
dove in the clefts of the rock, in the 
hollow places of the wall, show me thy 
face, let thy voice sound in my ear; for 
thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely.
