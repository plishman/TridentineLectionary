Impart upon Thy servants, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, the gift of heavenly 
grace: that, as the childbearing of the 
Blessed Virgin was the beginning of our
salvation, so the solemn feast of her 
Visitation may bring us an increase of 
peace. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts. Processus & 
Martinianus, Martyrs)O God, who dost encompass us and 
protect us by the glorious confession of
Thy holy Martyrs Processus and 
Martinian: grant that we may both profit
by their example and rejoice in their 
intercession. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
