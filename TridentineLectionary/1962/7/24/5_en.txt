At that time, Jesus spoke to His 
disciples this parable: The Kingdom of 
Heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in
a field. Which a man having found, hid 
it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth 
all that he hath, and buyeth that field. 
Again the Kingdom of Heaven is like to 
a merchant seeking good pearls. Who 
when he had found one pearl of great 
price, went his way, and sold all that he
had, and bought it. Again the Kingdom 
of Heaven is like to a net cast into the 
sea, and gathering together of all kind 
of fishes. Which, when it was filled, 
they drew out, and sitting by the shore, 
they chose out the good into vessels, 
but the bad they cast forth. So shall it 
be at the end of the world: the angels 
shall go out, and shall separate the 
wicked from among the just, and shall 
cast them into the furnace of fire: there 
shall be weeping and gnashing of 
teeth. Have ye understood all these 
things? They say to him: Yes. He said 
unto them: Therefore every scribe
instructed in the Kingdom of Heaven is
like to a man that is a householder, 
who bringeth forth out of his treasure 
new things and old.
