Filled with the Gifts of Thy divine 
bounty, we beseech Thee, O Lord, our 
God; that by the intercession of blessed
Christina, Thy Virgin and Martyr, we 
may partake thereof for evermore. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
