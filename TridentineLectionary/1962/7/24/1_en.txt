May blessed Christina, virgin and 
martyr, who was ever pleasing to Thee 
by her merit of chastity and by her 
extolling of Thy power, implore Thy 
forgiveness for us, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
