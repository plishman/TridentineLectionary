St. Christina, a Tuscan virgin, who when ten years old had taken and 
destroyed the silver idols in her father's house, was in consequence tied to a 
post and pierced with arrows. Her tomb was discovered in 1880; an examination
of her relics showed that she was scarcely more than fourteen years of age at 
the time of her death.
On this day the Greeks celebrate another St. Christina, martyr of Tyre. The 
Greeks salute her as a "stainless bride wounded by arrows."
