Thou shalt make them princes over all 
the earth: they shall remember Thy 
name, O Lord. Instead of thy fathers, 
sons are born to thee: therefore shall 
people praise thee. Alleluia, alleluia. 
(John 15: 16) I have chosen you out of 
the world, that you should go, and 
should bring forth fruit, and your fruit 
should remain. Alleluia.
