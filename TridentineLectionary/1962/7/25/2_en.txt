Brethren, I think that God hath set forth 
us apostles the last, as it were men 
appointed to death: we are made a 
spectacle to the world, and to angels, 
and to men. We are fools for Christ's 
sake, but you are wise in Christ: we are
weak, but you are strong: you are 
honorable, but we without honor. Even 
unto this hour we both hunger, and 
thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, 
and have no fixed abode, and we labor,
working with our own hands. We are 
reviled, and we bless: we are 
persecuted, and we suffer it: we are 
blasphemed, and we entreat: we are 
made as the refuse of this world, the 
offscouring of all even until now. I write 
not these things to confound you: but I 
admonish you as my dearest children: 
for if you have ten thousand instructors 
in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in 
Christ Jesus by the gospel I have 
begotten you.
