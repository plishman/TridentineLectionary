Be Thou, O Lord, the sanctifier, and the
guardian of Thy people, so that, being 
defended by the protection of Thine 
apostle James, they may both please 
Thee by their conduct and serve Thee 
with mind all untroubled. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that we, who honor the 
anniversary of the death of blessed 
Christopher, Thy Martyr, may by his 
intercession be strengthened in love of 
Thy name. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
