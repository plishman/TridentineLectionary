To me Thy friends, O God, are made 
exceedingly honorable: their principality
is exceedingly strengthened. (Ps. 138: 
1-2) Lord, Thou hast proved me, and 
known me; Thou hast known my sitting 
down and my rising up. Glory be to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. To me Thy friends, O 
God, are made exceedingly honorable: 
their principality is exceedingly 
strengthened.
