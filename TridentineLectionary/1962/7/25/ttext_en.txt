St. James was the brother of John, and the first of the Apostolic College to 
suffer martyrdom. He was beheaded by Herod Agrippa about the year 43. He 
was one of the intimate friends of Our Savior: he witnessed the Transfiguration 
and the agony in the Garden of Olives. Christ foretold his martyrdom on the 
occasion when the mother of James and John asked for her two sons that they 
be seated one at His right hand and one at his left in His Kingdom. James 
preached the Gospel in Judea and Samaria and even in distant Spain.
In the Sixth Century the tomb of the two apostles of the name of James was
still being venerated at Jerusalem. But in the Ninth Century we find that the 
relics of St. James the Greater were already the object of great devotion at 
Santiago de Compostella, whither they may have been carried after the Arabs 
had taken possession of the Holy City. Throughout the Middle Ages, the 
pilgrimage to Galicia to the tomb of St. James was one of the most popular of 
all, and wholly worthy of the special place which St. James occupied beside Our
Blessed Lord.
St. Christopher, Martyr: St. Christopher, a native of Chanaan, was martyred 
at Lycia in the Third Century. He was greatly venerated in the East. His name, 
which signifies "one who carries Christ," won for him great veneration even in 
the city of Rome. Many statues of St. Christopher were placed at the entrance to
cathedrals. He is the patron of travelers and is invoked in storms, tempests and 
plagues. The medal of St. Christopher is frequently attached to motor vehicles.
