May the holy sufferings of James, Thy 
blessed apostle, commend the 
offerings of Thy people, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord; and since they are not 
worthy for any merits of ours let them 
be made pleasing to Thee by his 
prayers. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Receive our gifts, and our prayers, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord; cleanse us by 
the heavenly Mysteries and mercifully 
hear us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
