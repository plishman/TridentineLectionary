St. Pius I, a great Pope of the Second Century, is said by tradition to have 
established a baptistery in the house of the Pudenti, or de Pastore. His
brother is the author of the Shepherd of Hermas which has been styled "a vast 
examination of the conscience of the Roman Church at the end of the first half 
of the Second Century." To St. Pius is attributed the fixation of the feast of the 
Resurrection on Sunday, which day then became the central Sunday of the year.
He was buried in the Vatican.
