St. Apollinaris was the disciple of St. Peter, who preached the Gospel at 
Ravenna. The importance of the See of Ravena in the Sixth Century brought 
about an attempt to exalt that See unduly. On this account we have in the Mass 
today the voice of St. Peter recommending the pastors of the Church to avoid 
the spirit of domination and pride, and the words of the Gospel teaching the 
lesson of humility. St. Apollinaris after a cruel scourging and exile was martyred 
at Ravenna in 79 A.D. The great cathedral of that city is dedicated to him.
St. Liborius was the fourth bishop of Le Mans, France. He was renowned for
the miracles which he wrought on behalf of those suffering from stone; his name
was added to the Calendar by Pope Clement XI, who suffered with this 
dangerous malady and was cured by the intercesion of the saint. He died about 
the year 397.
