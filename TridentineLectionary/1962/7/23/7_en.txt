Graciously look down upon these gifts, 
O Lord, which We bring in 
remembrance of Thy blessed priest 
and martyr, Apollinaris, and offer up for 
our offenses. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
May Thy saints, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, everywhere make us joyful, that, 
while we venerate their merits, we may 
experience their patronage. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
