At that time, There was a strife among 
the disciples, which of them should 
seem to be greater. And Jesus said to 
them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it 
over them; and they that have power 
over them, are called beneficent. But 
you not so; but he that is the greater 
among you, let him become as the 
younger; and he that is the leader, as 
he that serveth. For which is greater, he
that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? 
Is not he that sitteth at table? but I am 
in the midst of you, as he that serveth. 
And you are they who have continued 
with Me in My temptations: and I 
dispose to you, as My Father hath 
disposed to Me, a kingdom: that you 
may eat and drink at My table in My 
kingdom, and may sit upon thrones, 
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
