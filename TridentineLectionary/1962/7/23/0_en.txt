O ye priests of the Lord, bless the Lord:
O ye holy and humble of heart, praise 
God. (Daniel 3: 57) All ye works of the 
Lord, bless the Lord: praise and exalt 
Him above all for ever. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. O ye priests of the Lord, 
bless the Lord: O ye holy and humble 
of heart, praise God.
