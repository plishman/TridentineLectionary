O God, the rewarder of faithful souls, 
Who has consecrated this day to the 
martyrdom of blessed Apollinaris, Thy 
priest, grant us, Thy servants, we 
beseech Thee, that, as we observe his 
venerable feast, we may obtain 
forgiveness through his prayers. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that the august solemnity of Thy 
blessed confessor and bishop, Lib√≥rii, 
may increase our devotion and 
promote our salvation. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
