Dearly beloved: The ancients that are 
among you I beseech, who am myself 
also an ancient and a witness of the 
sufferings of Christ; as also a partaker 
of that glory which is to be revealed in 
time to come; feed the flock of God 
which is among you, taking care of it 
not by constraint, but willingly 
according to God; not for filthy lucre's 
sake, but voluntarily; neither as lording 
it over the clergy but being made a 
pattern of the flock from the heart: and 
when the Prince of pastors shall 
appear, you shall receive a never-
fading crown of glory. In like manner, ye
young men, be subject to the ancients: 
and do ye all insinuate humility one to 
another; for God resisteth the proud, 
but to the humble He giveth grace. Be 
you humbled therefore under the 
mighty hand of God, that He may exalt 
you in the time of visitation; casting all 
your care upon Him, for He hath care of
you. Be sober and watch, because your
adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, 
goeth about, seeking whom he may 
devour. Whom resist ye, strong in faith, 
knowing that the same affliction befalls 
your brethren who are in the world. But 
the God of all grace, Who hath called 
us unto His eternal glory in Christ 
Jesus, after you have suffered a little, 
will Himself perfect you, and confirm 
you, and establish you. To Him be glory
and empire for ever and ever. Amen
