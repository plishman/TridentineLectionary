Receiving Thy holy mysteries, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, that the 
continued protection of blessed 
Apollinaris may comfort us; for Thou 
dost not cease to regard mercifully 
those to whom Thou hast granted such 
aids for their assistance. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that as we thank Thee for the 
favors we have received, we may, by 
the intercession of blessed Liborius, 
Thy Confessor and Bishop, obtain still 
greater blessings. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
