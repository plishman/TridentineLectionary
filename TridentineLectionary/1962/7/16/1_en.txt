O God, Who hast honored the Order of 
the most blessed Mary, ever a virgin, 
Thy mother, with the special title of 
Carmel, graciously grant that we, who 
this day celebrate her commemoration 
with solemn service, may, being 
protected by her care, be worthy to 
attain to everlasting joys. Who lives and
reigns with God the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
