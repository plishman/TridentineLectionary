Today, the whole Latin Church joins with the Friars of the Blessed Virgin of 
Mount Carmel in celebrating the munificence of the Mother of God towards this 
Order, which is dedicated to her. The origin of this illustrious brotherhood, which
has given so many saints to the Church, is well known. A little while before the 
year 1185, a priest of Calabria having had a revelation of the prophet Elias, 
ascended Mount Carmel and began to restore one of the four ancient 
monasteries which he found there, and of which only the foundations remained.
The new institution prospered, and although the latest comer, it was able to graft
itself successfully upon the great tradition, already centuries old, of the monastic
life which Oriental cenobites and Benedictine monks had led on Mount Carmel. 
Albert, Patriarch of Jerusalem, gave certain rules of conduct to those hermits, 
who were living at that time under their superior Brocardo, rules which 
subsequently were approved, together with the new foundation, by Honorius III
and Gregory IX.
In the Thirteenth Century Innocent IV approved the rule under the 
generalship of Simon Stock. On July 16, 1251, the Carmelite habit was placed 
in his hands by the Blessed Virgin. It was blessed by the Pope and many 
privileges attached to it, not only for members of the Order, but for all those who 
enter the Confraternity of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and wear the scapular. The
Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was inserted into the Calendar under 
Benedict XlII in 1726.
