Let all rejoice in the Lord, celebrating a 
festival day in honor of the Blessed 
Virgin Mary, for whose Assumption the 
Angels rejoice and give praise to the 
Son of God. (Ps. 44: 2) My heart hath 
uttered a good word: I speak my works 
to the King. Glory be to the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. Let
all rejoice in the Lord, celebrating a 
festival day in honor of the Blessed 
Virgin Mary, for whose Assumption the 
Angels rejoice and give praise to the 
Son of God.
