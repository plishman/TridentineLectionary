May the august intercession of Mary, 
Thy glorious Mother, ever a virgin, help 
us, O Lord, that those whom it hath 
heaped with benefits it may deliver 
from all peril and by her tender 
kindness, make to be of one mind. Who
lives and reigns with God the Father in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
