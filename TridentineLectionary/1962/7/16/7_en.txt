Sanctify, we beseech Thee, O Lord, the
sacrifices we offer, and, by the most 
salutary intercession of blessed Mary, 
Mother of God grant them to be 
effectual for our salvation. Through the
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
