Born at Florence at the end of the Tenth Century, John Gualbert was trained
in the school of St. Benedict. Raised to the papacy he exalted that office and the
position of the hierarchy which had been degraded by the imperial power. He 
stamped out simony and brought back order and peace to the land of Tuscany. 
At Valombrosa he founded a monastery, whence came many saints and which 
still flourishes. On one occasion meeting the murderer of his brother, he 
pardoned him in the name of the Redeemer. He died on July 12, 1073, and was
canonized in 1193.
