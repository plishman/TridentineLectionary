May the holy Abbot John, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, obtain by his prayers, 
that the Sacrifice laid on Thy holy altar, 
may profit us unto salvation. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(For Sts. Nabor & Felix)May the gifts of Thy people, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, be made 
pleasing to Thee through the prayers of
Thy holy Martyrs Nabor an Felix, and 
as they are being offered to Thy name 
in celebration of their triumph, may they
be rendered worthy through their 
merits. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
