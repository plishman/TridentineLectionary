May the intercession of blessed John 
the Abbot comment us unto Thee, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord: so that what we
cannot acquire by any merits of ours, 
we may obtain by his patronage. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(For Sts. Nabor & Felix)Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, that 
as we never fail to keep the heavenly 
birthday of Thy Martyrs Nabor and 
Felix, so we may ever be assisted by 
their intercession. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
