May the pleading of blessed John, the 
Abbot, for us, as well as the reception 
of Thy Sacraments, protect us, O Lord, 
that we may both share in the glory of 
his works, and receive the help of his 
intercession. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(For Sts. Nabor & Felix)On the natal feast of Thy Saints, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, that, being 
strengthened by the gift of the 
sacrament, we may enjoy forever the 
good things with which, through Thy 
grace, we are now comforted. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
