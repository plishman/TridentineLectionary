At that time Jesus said to his disciples: 
You have heard that it hath been said, 
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate 
thy enemy. But I say to you, Love your 
enemies: do good to them that hate 
you: and pray for them that persecute 
and calumniate you: That you may be 
the children of your Father who is in 
heaven, who maketh his sun to rise 
upon the good, and bad, and raineth 
upon the just and the unjust. For if you 
love them that love you, what reward 
shall you have? do not even the 
publicans this? And if you salute your 
brethren only, what do you more? do 
not also the heathens this? Be you 
therefore perfect, as also your heavenly
Father is perfect.
