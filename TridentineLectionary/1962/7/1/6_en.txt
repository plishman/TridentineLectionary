Through these divine mysteries, we 
beseech Thee may we draw near to 
Jesus, the mediator of the New 
Testament, and renew upon Thine 
altars, O Lord of virtues, the sprinkling 
of the blood, which speaketh more 
eloquently than that of Abel. Through 
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
