Almighty, eternal God, Who hast 
appointed Thine only-begotten Son to 
be the Redeemer of the world, and hast
willed to be appeased by His blood, 
grant us, we beseech Thee, so 
incessantly to worship the price of our 
salvation, and to be so defended by its 
power from the ills of this life on earth, 
that we may enjoy its everlasting fruit in
Heaven. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
