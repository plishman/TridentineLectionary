In the liturgical reform of Pius X this day was chosen for the feast of the 
Most Precious Blood, which had already been fixed under Pius IX for the first 
Sunday in July. Pius IX instituted this feast in thanksgiving for the deliverance of
the Apostolic See from the violent revolutionaries who had expelled the Pope to 
Greta. In 1849, with the assistance of the French army, they were vanquished 
and the pope was able to return to Rome.
The meaning of this festival is closely akin to that of the Sacred Heart. The 
Precious Blood is the price of universal redemption, which love would not have 
to be anything less than itself. There is a very close connection between the 
Heart and the Blood not only because, according to St. John, after the death of 
Jesus, blood and water flowed from His wounded Heart, but because the first 
chalice in which that divine Blood was consecrated and vivified was precisely 
the Heart of the incarnate Word.
The apostle of this special devotion was the Blessed Gaspare del Bufalo, 
founder of the congregation of the Most Precious Blood. The Mass is of quite 
recent composition. In the ancient Roman rite the Mass of Passion Sunday was 
especially intended to recall to the remembrance of the faithful the inflnite value 
of the Blood of Jesus Christ.
