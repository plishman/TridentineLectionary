At that time, Jesus, when He had taken
the vinegar, said: It is consummated. 
And bowing His head He gave up the 
ghost. Then the Jews (because it was 
the parasceve), that the bodies might 
not remain upon the cross on the 
sabbath-day (for that was a great 
sabbath-day), besought Pilate that their
legs might be broken, and that they 
might be taken away. The soldiers, 
therefore, came: and they broke the 
legs of the first and of the other that 
was crucified with him. But after they 
were come to Jesus, when they saw 
that He was already dead, they did not 
break His legs. But one of the soldiers 
with a spear opened His side, and 
immediately there came out blood and 
water. And he that saw it hath given 
testimony, and his testimony is true.
