Thou hast redeemed us, O Lord, in Thy
blood, out of every tribe and tongue, 
and people, and nation, and hast made
us to our God a kingdom. (Ps. 88: 2) 
The mercies of the Lord I will sing 
forever: I will show forth Thy truth with 
my mouth to generation and 
generation. Glory be to the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Thou hast redeemed us, O Lord, in Thy
blood, out of every tribe and tongue, 
and people, and nation, and hast made
us to our God a kingdom.
