This is He that came by water and 
blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, 
but by water and blood. There are 
three Who give testimony in heaven: 
the Father, the Word, and the Holy 
Spirit; and these three are one. And 
there are three that give testimony on 
earth: the Spirit, the water, and the 
blood; and these three are one. 
Alleluia, alleluia. (I John 5: 9) If we 
receive the testimony of men, the 
testimony Of God is greater. Alleluia.
