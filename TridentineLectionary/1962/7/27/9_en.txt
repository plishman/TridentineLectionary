Refreshed by participation in the 
sacred gift, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
our God, that, through the intercession 
of blessed Pantaleon, Thy martyr, we 
may ever experience the effect of the 
worship we perform. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
