St. Pantaleon was a physician of Nicomedia. His name signifies in the 
Greek "many shall obtain mercy"; it was given him by Christ with this promise. 
During his martyrdom Our Lord appeared to him as he was tortured on the rack 
and burned with flaming torches. He is the principal patron (after St. Luke) of the
medical profession. His blood liquifies on his feast day in the phial in which it is 
preserved at Ravello near Amalfi.
