The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and 
shall hope in Him: and all the upright in 
heart shall be praised. (Ps.63: 2) Hear, 
O God, my prayer when I make 
supplication to Thee: deliver my soul 
from the fear of the enemy. Glory be to
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. The just shall rejoice in 
the Lord, and shall hope in Him: and all
the upright in heart shall be praised.
