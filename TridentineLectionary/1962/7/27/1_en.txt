Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that, by the intercession of 
blessed Pantaleon, Thy martyr, we may
be both delivered from all adversities 
of the body and cleansed from all evil 
thoughts of the mind. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
