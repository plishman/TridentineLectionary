O God, Who bountifully providest for 
Thy people, and lovingly rulest over 
them, do Thou, through the interceding 
merits of the Chief Bishops of Thy 
Church, give the Spirit of Wisdom to 
those unto whom Thou hast given the 
control of its discipline, that the good 
advance of their holy flocks may be to 
the Shepherds a source of everlasting 
joy. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
