May the spotless sacrifice of Thine 
only-begotten Son which we offer unto 
Thee, O God, the Father Almighty, in 
honor of the holy Pontiffs, help us to 
obtain the spiritual remedy. Through 
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
