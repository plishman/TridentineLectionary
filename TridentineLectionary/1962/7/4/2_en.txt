Brethren: Remember your prelates who
have spoken the word of God to you: 
whose faith follow, considering the end 
of their conversation, Jesus Christ, 
yesterday, and today: and the same for 
ever. Be not led away with various and 
strange doctrines. For it is best that the 
heart be established with grace, not 
with meats: which have not profited 
those that walk in them. We have an 
altar whereof they have no power to eat
who serve the tabernacle. For the 
bodies of those beasts whose blood is 
brought into the holies by the high 
priest for sin are burned without the 
camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that he 
might sanctify the people by his own 
blood, suffered without the gate. Let us 
go forth therefore to him without the 
camp, bearing his reproach. For, we 
have not here a lasting city: but we 
seek one that is to come. By him 
therefore let us offer the sacrifice of 
praise always to God, that is to say, the
fruit of lips confessing to his name. And
do not forget to do good and to impart: 
for by such sacrifices God's favor is 
obtained. Obey your prelates and be 
subject to them. For they watch as 
being to render an account of your 
souls: that they may do this with joy 
and not with grief. For this is not 
expedient for you.
