Gather ye together His saints to Him, 
who have set His Covenant before 
sacrifices. And the heavens shall 
declare His justice, because I am thy 
God. (P.T. Alleluia, alleluia.) (Ps. 49: 1)
The God of gods, the Lord, hath 
spoken and hath called the earth. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Gather ye 
together His saints to Him, who have 
set His Covenant before sacrifices. And
the heavens shall declare His justice, 
because I am thy God. (P.T. Alleluia, 
alleluia.)
