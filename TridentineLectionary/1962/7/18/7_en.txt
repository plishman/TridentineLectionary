May this unspotted victim, with which 
we renew the great work of Our Lord 
Jesus Christ's infinite charity, be, 
through the intercession of blessed 
Camillus, our saving remedy against all
infirmities of body and soul, and, in the 
last agony, our solace and protection. 
Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, our Lord, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Symphorosa &
her Seven Sons, Martyrs)We offer Thee, O Lord, the gifts of our 
homage; may they be pleasing to Thee 
in honor of Thy just ones, and by Thy 
mercy, may they become profitable for 
our salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
