Greater love than this no man hath, 
that a man lay down his life for his 
friends. (Ps. 40: 2) Blessed is he that 
understandeth concerning the needy 
and poor: the Lord will deliver him in 
the evil day. Glory be to the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Greater love than this no man hath, 
that a man lay down his life for his 
friends.
