O God, Who didst adorn blessed 
Camillus with a special gift of charity for
the help of souls struggling in their last 
agony, pour upon us, we beseech 
Thee, by his merits, the spirit of Thy 
love, that in the hour of our death we 
may be worthy to overcome the enemy 
and attain unto the heavenly crown. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Symphorosa &
her Seven Sons, Martyrs)O God, Who permits us to celebrate 
the anniversary of the death of Thy holy
Martyrs, Symphorosa and her sons, 
grant us to rejoice in their 
companionship in everlasting 
happiness. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
