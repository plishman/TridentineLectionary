St. Camillus of Lellis was born in 1550 of a noble family. He tried twice to 
enter the Capuchin Order, but each time had to leave on account of a sore on 
his leg. He then spent his life in ministering to the sick in the hospitals of St. 
Giacomo degli Incurabili, and of the Santo Spirito. He instituted a congregation 
of regular Clerics, devoted to the care of the sick. St. Philip Neri, who at one 
time was his confessor, saw in a vision that the angels themselves inspired the 
religious instituted by him with the words best suited to comfort the dying. Leo 
XIII appointed him the celestial patron of those who are at the point of death; 
his name is in the Litany of the Dying. He died at Rome, July 14, 1614.
Commemoration of St. Symphorosa and Her Children: Symphorosa and her 
sons were martyred under Hadrian in the year 120. The mother was drowned on
this day in the River Anio, whilst her sons had already won the crown of 
martyrdom on June 27; Crescens had been stabbed in the throat, Julian in the 
breast, Nemesius in the heart, Primitivus in the stomach; Justin had received his
death-wound in the back, Stacteus in the side, and Eugenius had been actually 
cleft in two. The bodies of the Tiburtine martyrs were brought to Rome by 
Stephen III, and were placed in the deaconry church of St. Michael.
