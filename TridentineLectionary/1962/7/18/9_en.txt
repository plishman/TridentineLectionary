Through this heavenly nourishment 
which we have received with pious 
devotion, in celebrating the solemnity of
blessed Camillus, Thy confessor, grant,
we beseech Thee, O Lord, that in the 
hour of our death, refreshed by Thy 
sacraments, and all our sins forgiven, 
we may deserve to be taken up, 
rejoicing, into the bosom of Thy mercy. 
Who lives and reigns with God the 
Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Symphorosa &
her Seven Sons, Martyrs)Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, by 
the intercession of Thy holy Martyrs, 
Symphorosa and her sons, that what 
we taste with our lips we may consume
with pure heart. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
