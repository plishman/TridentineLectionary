At that time, Jesus said His to His 
disciples: This is My commandment, 
that you love one another, as I have 
loved you. Greater love than this no 
man hath, that a man lay down his life 
for his friends. You are My friends, if 
you do the things that I command you. I
will not now call you servants; for the 
servant knoweth not what his lord doth.
But I have called you friends; because 
all things whatsoever I have heard of 
My Father, I have made known to you. 
You have not chosen Me, but I have 
chosen you; and have appointed you 
that you should go, and should bring 
forth fruit; and your fruit should remain: 
that whatsoever you shall ask of the 
Father in My name, He may give it you.
