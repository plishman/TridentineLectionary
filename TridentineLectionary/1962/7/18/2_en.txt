Dearly beloved, Wonder not if the world
hate you. We know that we have 
passed from death to life, because we 
love the brethren. He that loveth not, 
abideth in death. Whomever hateth his 
brother is a murderer: and you know 
that no murderer hath eternal life 
abiding in himself. In this we have 
known the charity of God, because He 
hath laid down His life for us: and we 
ought to lay down our lives for the 
brethren. He that hath the substance of
this world, and shall see his brother in 
need, and shut up his bowel from him, 
how doth the charity of God abide in 
him? My little children, let us not love in
word nor in tongue, but in deed and in 
truth.
