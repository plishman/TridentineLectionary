God, the Father of mercies, grant, by 
the intercession of blessed Jerome, 
whom Thou didst will to be the helper 
and father of orphans, that we may 
faithfully guard the spirit of adoption 
whereby we are both in name and 
reality Thy children. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Margaret, 
Virgin & Martyr)May blessed Margaret, Virgin and 
Martyr, who was ever pleasing to Thee 
by the merit of her chastity and by her 
trust in Thy power, implore for us Thy 
forgiveness, we beseech Thee, O Lord.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
