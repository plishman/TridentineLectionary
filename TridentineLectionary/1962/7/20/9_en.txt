Refreshed with the bread of angels we 
humbly ask of Thee, O Lord, that we, 
who joyfully celebrate the annual 
commemoration of blessed Jerome, 
Thy confessor, may also imitate his 
example and be enabled to obtain a 
most abundant reward in Thy kingdom. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Margaret, 
Virgin & Martyr)We who have been refreshed by the 
richness of Thy divine sacrament, 
beseech Thee, O Lord, our God, that 
through the intercession of blessed 
Margaret, Thy Virgin and Martyr, we 
may forevermore abide in its 
participation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
