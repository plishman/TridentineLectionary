Most merciful God,, Who, having 
destroyed the old man, didst vouchsafe
to create in blessed Jerome a new man
according to Thee, grant by his merits 
that we, renewed in like manner, may 
offer this sacrifice of propitiation for an 
odor of sweetness unto Thee. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(Commemoration of St. Margaret, 
Virgin & Martyr)Graciously accept the sacrificial gifts 
offered Thee, O Lord, through the 
merits of blessed Margaret, Thy Virgin 
and Martyr, and grant that they may 
prove an unfailing aid for us. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
