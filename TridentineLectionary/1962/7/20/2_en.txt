Thus said the Lord: Deal thy bread to 
the hungry, and bring the needy and 
the harborless into thy house: when 
thou shalt see one naked, cover him, 
and despise not thy own flesh. Then 
shall thy light break forth as the 
morning, and thy health shall speedily 
arise, and thy justice shall go before thy
face, and the glory of the Lord shall 
gather thee up. Then shalt thou call, 
and the Lord shall hear: thou shalt cry, 
and He shall say, Here I am. If thou wilt
take away the chain out of the midst of 
thee, and cease to stretch out the 
finger, and to speak that which profiteth
not. When thou shalt pour out thy soul 
to the hungry, and shalt satisfy the 
afflicted soul, then shall thy light rise up
in darkness, and thy darkness shall be 
as the noonday. And the Lord will give 
thee rest continually, and will fill thy 
soul with brightness, and deliver thy 
bones: and thou shalt be like a watered
garden, and like a fountain of water 
whose waters shall not fail.
