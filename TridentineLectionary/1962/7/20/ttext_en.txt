In the Sixteenth Century God raised up a number of saints who by prayer, 
teaching and good works combated the influence of the pagan Renaissance. 
Among these was St. Jerome Emiliani, who spent himself in the care of orphans
and the poor. He instituted homes for orphan children, and founded the 
Congregation whose object was to educate orphans. They are called the 
Somaschi, from Somascha, the little Italian town in which they were first 
established. He died on February 8, 1537, from the plague which he contracted 
while burying the dead. It was related that St. Charles Borromeo, when going 
several years afterwards to make a pastoral visitation at Somascha, became 
aware of the presence of the relics of a saint through the sweet perfume which 
emanated from his tomb. Asking for a thurible, St. Charles offered incense on 
the sepulcher, being thus the first to render public veneration to the saint.
Commemoration of St. Margaret: St. Margaret, called by the Greeks, Marina, 
was martyred at Antioch in Pisidia under Emperor Diocletian at the end of the 
Third Century. Devotion to her became very popular in Rome during the Middle 
Ages, and many chapels and churches were dedicated to her. She is invoked, 
especially, by those who are about to become mothers.
