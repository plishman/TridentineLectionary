At that time, little children were 
presented to Him, that He should 
impose hands upon them, and pray. 
And the disciples rebuked them. But 
Jesus said to them, Suffer the little 
children, and forbid them not to come 
to Me; for the kingdom of Heaven is for 
such. And when He had imposed 
hands upon them, He departed from 
thence. And behold one came to Him, 
and said to Him, Good master, what 
good shall I do, that I may have life 
everlasting? Who then said to him, 
Why askest thou Me concerning good? 
One is good, God. But if thou wilt enter 
into life, keep the commandments. He 
said to Him, Which? And Jesus said, 
Thou shalt do no murder, thou shalt not
commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, 
thou shalt not bear false witness, honor
thy father and thy mother; and thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. The 
young man saith to Him, All these 
things have I kept from my youth; what 
is yet wanting to me? Jesus saith to 
him, If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell what
thou hast, and give to the poor, and 
thou shalt have treasure in Heaven: 
and come, follow Me.
