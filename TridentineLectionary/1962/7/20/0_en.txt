Poured out upon the earth is my liver, 
for the destruction of the daughter of 
my people, when the child and the 
suckling fainted away in the streets of 
the city. (Ps. 112: 1) Praise the Lord, ye
children: praise ye the name of the 
Lord. Glory be to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in 
the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. Poured 
out upon the earth is my liver, for the 
destruction of the daughter of my 
people, when the child and the suckling
fainted away in the streets of the city.
