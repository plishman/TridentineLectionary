The Latin writers, beginning With Tertullian, have generally and with great 
probability identified Mary of Magdala as the sister of Lazarus, and as the sinner
who anointed the feet of Jesus. The Greeks, on the other hand, distinguished 
three Marys. Her brother Lazarus, died in the island of Cyprus. His body was 
brought to Constantinople by the Emperor Leo VI and laid in the Lazarion, (899).
The body of Mary, his sister, who, according to a tradition dating from the Sixth 
Century, had been buried at Ephesus, was soon brought and laid beside him in 
the new sepulchral basilica of Byzantium. The Greeks give to her the title of "like
unto an apostle", because she first announced to the world and to the apostles 
themselves the Resurrection of the Lord.
The scene of the conversion of Mary of Magdala is perhaps one of the 
incidents in the Gospel which best reveal the gentleness of the heart of the 
Redeemer. To Mary much is forgiven, because she loved much; this is the 
remedy for sinners; this is the spirit which sustains the Church Militant, wherein 
we may indeed see many sins caused by human frailty, but in which there may 
be found also a great love ready to pardon all.
