I will rise and will go about the city: in 
the streets and the broad ways I will 
seek Him Whom my soul loveth: I 
sought Him, and I found Him not. The 
watchmen who keep the city found me. 
Have you seen Him Whom my soul 
loveth? When I had a little passed by 
them, I found Him Whom my soul 
loveth; I held Him, and I will not let Him 
go till I bring Him into my mother's 
house, and into the chamber of her that
bore me. I adjure you, O daughters of 
Jerusalem, by the roes and harts of the
fields, that you stir not up, nor wake my
beloved till she please. Put me as a 
seal upon Thy heart, as a seal upon 
Thy arm; for love is strong as death, 
jealousy is hard as hell; the lamps 
thereof are lamps of fire and flames. 
Many waters cannot quench charity, 
neither can the floods drown it; if a man
shall give all the substance of his 
house for love, he shall despise it as 
nothing.
