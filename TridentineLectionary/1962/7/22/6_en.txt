May the glorious merits of blessed 
Mary Magdalen, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, render our gifts acceptable to 
Thee, as Thine only-begotten Son 
mercifully received the homage of the 
offering which she presented. Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
