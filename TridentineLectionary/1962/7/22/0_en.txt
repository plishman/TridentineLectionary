The wicked have waited for me to 
destroy me; I have understood Thy 
testimonies, O Lord: I have seen an 
end of all perfection: Thy 
commandment is exceedingly broad. 
(Ps. 118: 1) Blessed are the undefiled 
in the way: who walk in the law of the 
Lord. Glory be to the Father, and to the 
Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in 
the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. The 
wicked have waited for me to destroy 
me; I have understood Thy testimonies,
O Lord: I have seen an end of all 
perfection: Thy commandment is 
exceedingly broad.
