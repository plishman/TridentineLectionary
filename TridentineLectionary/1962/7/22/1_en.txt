May we be assisted, O Lord, we 
beseech Thee, by the intercession of 
blessed Mary Magdalen for whom, 
moved by her prayers, Thou didst bring
back her brother Lazarus, then dead for
four days, alive from the grave. Who 
lives and reigns with God the Father in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
