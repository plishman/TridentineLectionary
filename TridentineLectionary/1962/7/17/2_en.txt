Dearly beloved: Godliness with 
contentment is great gain. For we 
brought nothing into this world, and 
certainly we can carry nothing out. But 
having food, and wherewith to be 
covered, with these we are content. For
they that will become rich, fall into 
temptation, and into the snare of the 
devil, and into many unprofitable and 
hurtful desires, which drown men in 
destruction and perdition. For 
covetousness is the root of all evils; 
which some desiring have erred from 
the Faith. and have entangled 
themselves in many sorrows. But thou, 
O man of God, fly these things; and 
pursue justice, godliness, faith, charity,
patience, meekness. Fight the good 
fight of faith; lay hold on eternal life.
