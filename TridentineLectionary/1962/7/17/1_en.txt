O God, Who dost gladden us by the 
annual feast of blessed Alexis, Thy 
confessor, mercifully grant that, as we 
celebrate his natal day, we may also 
imitate his actions. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
