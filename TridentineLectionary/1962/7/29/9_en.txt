Thou hast filled Thy household, O Lord,
with sacred gifts; ever comfort us, we 
beseech Thee, through her 
intercession whose festival we 
celebrate. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

<i>(Commemoration of Sts. Felix, 
Simplicius, Faustinus, & Beatrice)</i>
<br>
Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that the solemnity of Thy holy 
martyrs, Felix, Simplicius, Faustinus, 
and Beatrice, celebrated with the 
sacred mysteries, may acquire for us 
the grant of Thy forgiveness of our sins.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
