Harken unto us, O God, our Savior that
as we rejoice in the festival of blessed 
Martha, Thy virgin, so we may be 
instructed by the affection of pious 
devotion. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

<i>(Commemoration of Sts. Felix, 
Simplicius, Faustinus, & Beatrice)</i>
<br>
Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, that 
as Thy Christian people joyfully unite in
celebrating the temporal solemnity of 
Thy holy martyrs Felix, Simplicius, 
Faustinus, and Beatrice, so they may 
enjoy it in eternity, and may effectually 
attain to what they celebrate in desire.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
