May the offering of Thy consecrated 
people be accepted by Thee, O Lord, in
honor of Thy saints, by whose merits it 
knoweth that it hath received aid in time
of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

<i>(Commemoration of Sts. Felix, 
Simplicius, Faustinus, & Beatrice)</i>
<br>
We bring Thee sacrifices, O Lord, for 
the commemoration of Thy holy 
martyrs, Felix, Simplicius, Faustinus, 
and Beatrice, humbly praying that they 
may obtain for us at once forgiveness 
and salvation. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
