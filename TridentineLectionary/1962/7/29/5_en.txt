At that time, Jesus entered into a 
certain town; and a certain woman 
named Martha, received Him into her 
house: and she had a sister called 
Mary, who sitting also at the Lord's feet,
heard His word. But Martha was busy 
about much serving: who stood and 
said, Lord, hast Thou no care that my 
sister hath left me alone to serve? 
Speak to her therefore, that she help 
me. And the Lord answering, said to 
her: Martha, Martha, thou art careful, 
and art troubled about many things: but
one thing is necessary. Mary hath 
chosen the best part, which shall not be
taken away from her.
