The ways by which God leads men's souls are varied; one way may be 
more perfect than another, but each soul must sanctify itself in its own fashion. 
Grace does not do violence to nature, but perfects it; thus, although St. John 
tells us that Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, each of the sisters always 
retains her own individual character in the Gospel narrative. Mary feels more 
deeply, and, therefore, though she is habitually more recollected, yet she is also 
a woman of an eager and pleasing disposition, more courageous in her actions.
The virtues of Martha, the elder sister of Lazarus, on the other hand, are 
more commonplace and less exceptional. She is a good housekeeper, diligent, 
affectionate, and forbearing in undertaking the additional labor which Mary's 
different nature puts upon her. In discharging her daily duties she looks at life 
chiefly from the practical side. The Savior loves her much, because, though 
Mary is eager to receive spiritual food from him, Martha, on the contrary, shows 
a mother's tender care both for Him and for His disciples, who were always 
received as members of the family in her home at Bethany.
Sts. Felix II, Simplicius, Faustinus, and Beatrice, Martyrs: The martyr-Pope 
St. Felix II governed the Church during the exile of Pope Liberius, in the middle 
of the Fourth Century. Simplicius and Faustinus were drowned in the Tiber, 
probably in 303, when the great persecution under Diocletian was at its height. 
Beatrice, their sister, with the aid of the priest Priscus, recovered their bodies in 
order to give them burial; for which offence she was strangled in prison.
