Be appeased, O Lord, we beseech 
Thee, and look upon the sacrifices here
before Thee, that, by the intercession 
of blessed Anne, who was the mother 
of Thy Son's mother, Our Lord Jesus 
Christ, they may profit both for our 
devotion and our salvation. Through 
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
