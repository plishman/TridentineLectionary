Let us all rejoice in the Lord, 
celebrating a festival-day in honor of 
blessed Anne; on whose solemnity the 
angels rejoice, and give praise to the 
Son of God. (Ps. 44: 2) My heart hath 
uttered a good word: I speak my works 
to the King. Glory be to the Father, 
and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now, and 
ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen. Let us all rejoice in the Lord, 
celebrating a festival-day in honor of 
blessed Anne; on whose solemnity the 
angels rejoice, and give praise to the 
Son of God.
