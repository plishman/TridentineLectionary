The privileges and graces with, which God had surrounded the Immaculate 
Conception of His Blessed Mother Mary were reflected upon her happy parents,
Joachim and Anne. We find, therefore, that in the Sixth Century Justinian built a 
church at Constantinople in honor of St. Anne. Devotion to the grandparents of 
the divine Redeemer spread almost everywhere in the East. The Syrians 
venerated St. Anne, under the name of Dina, on July 25; other eastern 
Churches placed her feast on another date. Pope Leo III placed pictures of 
Joachim and Anne in the Church of St. Mary Major. Gregory XIII in 1584 
inserted the feast of St. Ann in the Roman Missal.
At Rome in the patriarchal basilica of St. Paul the precious relic of the arm of
St. Anne was venerated even in the days of St. Bridget of Sweden, who 
obtained a very small portion of it as a gift. St. Anne then appeared to her and 
showed her how to venerate and take care of the sacred relics. Leo XIII and 
Benedict XV have given several fragments of this arm of St. Ann to celebrated 
sanctuaries dedicated to her in Canada and in Normandy, where God has been 
pleased to honor them by performing various miracles. Her feast was extended
to the Universal Church by Pope Leo XIII in 1879. Pope Benedict XV visited her
chapel outside the Vatican; this was the first time after 1870 that a Pope
left the Vatican.
