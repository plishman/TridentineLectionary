O God, Who didst vouchsafe to confer 
grace on blessed Anne that she might 
deserve to be made the mother of the 
mother of Thine only-begotten Son, 
mercifully grant that, as we celebrate 
her solemnity, we may be assisted with 
Thee by her patronage. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
