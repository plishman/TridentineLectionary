Nourished by Thy Heavenly 
sacraments, we beseech Thee, O Lord,
our God, that, by the intercession of 
blessed Anne, whom Thou didst will to 
be the mother of Thy Son's mother, we 
may be worthy to attain unto 
everlasting salvation. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
