At that time, Jesus spoke this parable 
to His disciples: The kingdom of 
Heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in
a field; which a man having found, hid 
it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth 
all that he hath, and buyeth that field. 
Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like to 
a merchant seeking good pearls. Who, 
when he had found one pearl of great 
price, went his way and sold all that he 
had, and bought it. Again, the kingdom 
of Heaven is like to a net cast into the 
sea, and gathering together of all kinds 
of fishes; which, when it was filled, they
drew out, and sitting by the shore, they 
chose out the good into vessels, but 
the bad they cast forth. So shall it be at 
the end of the world. The angels shall 
go out, and shall separate the wicked 
from among the just, and shall cast 
them into the furnace of fire; there shall
be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
Have ye understood all these things? 
They say to Him, Yes. He said unto 
them, Therefore, every scribe 
instructed in the kingdom of Heaven, is 
like to a man who is a householder, 
who bringeth forth out of his treasure 
new things and old.
