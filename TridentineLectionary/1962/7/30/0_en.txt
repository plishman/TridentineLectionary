Let the sighings of the prisoners come 
in before Thee, O Lord; render to our 
neighbors sevenfold in their bosom; 
revenge the blood of Thy Saints, which 
hath been shed. (Ps. 78: 1) O God, the 
heathens are come into Thine 
inheritance; they have defiled Thy holy 
temple: they have made Jerusalem as 
a place to keep fruit. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Let the sighings of the 
prisoners come in before Thee, O Lord;
render to our neighbors sevenfold in 
their bosom; revenge the blood of Thy 
Saints, which hath been shed.
