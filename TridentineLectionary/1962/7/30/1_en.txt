O God, Who didst bestow upon Thy 
saints, Abdon and Sennen, an 
abundance of grace to bring them to 
this glory, grant to Thy servants the 
pardon of their sins,that, by the 
interceding merits of Thy saints, they 
may deserve to be delivered from all 
adversities. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
