At that time: Jesus seeing the 
multitudes, went up into a mountain: 
and when He was sat down, His 
disciples came unto Him. And opening 
His mouth, He taught them, saying: 
Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs 
is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are 
the meek, for they shall possess the 
land. Blessed are they that mourn; for 
they shall be comforted. Blessed are 
they that hunger and thirst after justice; 
for they shall have their fill. Blessed are
the merciful; for they shall obtain 
mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart; 
for they shall see God. Blessed are the 
peace-makers; for they shall be called 
the children of God. Blessed are they 
that suffer persecution for justice' sake;
for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. 
Blessed are ye when they shall revile 
you, and persecute you, and speak all 
that is evil against, untruly, for My sake:
be glad and rejoice, for your reward is 
very great in Heaven.
