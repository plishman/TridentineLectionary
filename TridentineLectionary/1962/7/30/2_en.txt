Brethren: In all things let us exhibit 
ourselves as the ministers of God, in 
much patience, in tribulation, in 
necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in 
prisons, in seditions, in labors, in 
watchings, in fastings, in chastity, in 
knowledge, in long-suffering, in 
sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in 
charity unfeigned, in the word of truth, 
in the power of God: by the armor of 
justice on the right hand and on the 
left: by honor and dishonor: by evil 
report and good report: as deceivers, 
and yet true: as unknown, and yet 
known: as dying, and behold we live: 
as chastised, and not killed: as 
sorrowful, yet always rejoicing: as 
needy, yet enriching many: as having 
nothing, and possessing all things.
