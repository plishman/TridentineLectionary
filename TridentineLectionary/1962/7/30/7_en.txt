May this offering, which we present, O 
Lord, in commemorating the natal feast
of Thy martyrs, both loose, we 
beseech Thee, the bonds of our base 
desires and win for us the gifts of Thy 
mercy. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
