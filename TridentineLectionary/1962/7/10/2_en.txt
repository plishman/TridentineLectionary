Who shall find a valiant woman? the 
price of her is as of things brought from
afar off, and from the uttermost coasts. 
The heart of her husband trusteth in 
her, and he shall have no need of 
spoils. She will render him good and 
not evil all the days of her life. She hath
sought wool and flax, and hath wrought
by the counsel of her hands: she is like 
the merchant's ship, she bringeth her 
bread from afar: and she hath risen in 
the night, and given a prey to her 
household, and victuals to her 
maidens: she hath considered a field 
and bought it; with the fruit of her hands
she hath planted a vineyard. She hath 
girded her loins with strength, and hath 
strengthened her arm. She hath tasted 
and seen that her traffic is good; her 
lamp shall not be put out in the night. 
She hath put out her hands to strong 
things, and her fingers have taken hold 
of the spindle. She hath opened her 
hand to the needy, and stretched out 
her hands to the poor. She shall not 
fear for her house in the cold of snow: 
for all her domestics are clothed with 
double garments. She hath made for 
herself clothing of tapestry; fine linen 
and purple is her covering. Her 
husband is honorable in the gates, 
when he sitteth among the senators of 
the land. She made fine linen and sold 
it, and delivered a girdle to the 
Chanaanite. Strength and beauty are 
her clothing: and she shall laugh in the 
latter day. She hath opened her mouth 
to wisdom, and the law of clemency is 
on her tongue: she hath looked well to 
the paths of her house, and hath not 
eaten her bread idle. Her children rose 
up, and called her blessed; her 
husband, and he praised her. Many 
daughters have gathered together 
riches; thou hast surpassed them all. 
Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain: 
the woman that feareth the Lord, she 
shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of 
her hands; and let her works praise her
in the gates.
