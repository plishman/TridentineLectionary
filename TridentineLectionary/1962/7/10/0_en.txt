Praise the Lord, ye children, praise ye 
the name of the Lord; Who maketh the 
barren woman to dwell in a house, the 
joyful mother of children. (Ps. 112: 2) 
Blessed be the name of the Lord, from 
henceforth, now and forever. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Praise the 
Lord, ye children, praise ye the name of
the Lord; Who maketh the barren 
woman to dwell in a house, the joyful 
mother of children.
