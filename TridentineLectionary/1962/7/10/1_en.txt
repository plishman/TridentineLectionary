Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that, we, who have known the 
courage of the glorious martyrs in their 
confessing Thee, may experience their 
kindness in interceding for us with 
Thee. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
