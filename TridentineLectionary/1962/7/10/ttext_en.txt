Felicitas and her seven sons were put to death for the Faith, about the year 
162, under Marcus Aurelius. The sons preceded their mother to heaven; she 
followed them four months afterwards. In order to strike terror into the hearts of 
the Christians, the death sentences were not all carried out in the same place, 
for Januarius was beaten to death with leaden scourges and was buried in the 
Cemetery of Praetextatus. Felix and Philip died under the whip and received 
burial in that of Priscilla. Silanus was thrown from a precipice and was interred 
with his mother in the Cemetery of Maximus. Alexander, Vitalis, and Martial were
beheaded and were given the honor of sepulture in the Cemetery of the 
Giordani.
Under the Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, a hundred years later, two 
sisters Rufina and Secunda, rather than lose their consecrated virginity, 
accepted martyrdom. The forest in which they were put to death, hitherto called 
the dark wood, soon was called the bright wood in their honor.
