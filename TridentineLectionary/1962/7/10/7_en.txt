Be appeased, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, and look upon the sacrifices here 
before Thee, and may they, by the 
intercession of Thy saints, benefit both 
our devotion and our salvation. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
