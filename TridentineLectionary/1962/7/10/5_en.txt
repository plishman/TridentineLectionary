At that time: As Jesus was speaking to 
the multitudes, behold His mother and 
His brethren stood without seeking to 
speak to Him; and one said to Him, 
Behold Thy mother and Thy brethren 
stand without, seeking Thee. But He 
answering him that told Him, said, 
Who is My mother, and who are My 
brethren? And stretching forth His 
hand toward His disciples, He said, 
Behold My mother and My brethren: for
whosoever shall do the will of My father
that is in heaven, he is My brother, and 
sister, and mother.
