Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that, by the intercession of Thy 
saints, we may obtain the effect of that 
salvation of which we through these 
mysteries have received a pledge. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
