May the offerings of thy holy people be 
accepted by Thee, O Lord, in honor of 
Thy saints, through whose merits they 
know that they have received aid in 
time of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
