St. Elizabeth, Queen of Portugal, was born in 1271 and died July 4, 1336. 
She was distinguished for her devotion to the poor and her heroic acts of charity.
Her special grace was that of making peace. The joy caused at the Aragonese 
Court by the birth of Elizabeth brought about the reconciliation of her father and 
her grandfather; death surprised the good queen whilst on a journey which she 
had undertaken for the purpose of procuring peace between her son and her 
son-in-law.
