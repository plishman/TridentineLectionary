Most merciful God, Who, among other 
noble gifts, didst adorn Elizabeth, the 
blessed queen, with the gift of allaying 
the furies of war, grant us, by her 
intercession, after the peace which we 
seek in this mortal life, to attain unto 
everlasting joys. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.

at the end of this Mass, is often read.)(On the feast of a holy widow, the
