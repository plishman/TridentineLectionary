God, Who, to spread abroad the 
greater glory of Thy name, didst, 
through blessed Ignatius, strengthen 
the Church militant with a new 
reinforcement, grant that we, who are 
fighting on earth by his help and after 
his example, may deserve to be 
crowned with him in Heaven. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
