In the name of Jesus let every knee 
bow, of things in Heaven, on earth, and
under the earth: and let every tongue 
confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in 
the glory of God the Father. (Ps. 5: 12-
13) All they that love Thy name shall 
glory in Thee: for Thou wilt bless the 
just. Glory be to the Father, and to the 
Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in 
the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. In the 
name of Jesus let every knee bow, of 
things in Heaven, on earth, and under 
the earth: and let every tongue confess 
that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory
of God the Father.
