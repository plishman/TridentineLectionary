St. Ignatius, founder of the Society of Jesus, was born at Loyola in Spain,
in the year 1491. He served his king as a soldier till his thirtieth year. 
Convalescing from a severe wound received at the siege of Pampeluna, he was
given, in the absence of other books, the Lives of Jesus Christ and of the 
Saints. It dawned on his chivalric nature that the Church has need of her army 
to defend under the sovereign Pontiff the interest of God against heresy and all 
evil. On his recovery he ascended Montserrat and in the Benedictine Abbey. 
There he laid down his sword at the feet of the Blessed Virgin. He learned here 
to love the Psalms and canticles of the Divine Office which he was later to 
recommend to the faithful; he desired that those who were to make his Spiritual 
Exercises should choose a dwelling whence they could easily go to the Offices 
of Matins and Vespers as well as to Mass. Among the Benedictines of St. Paul's 
in Rome, Ignatius pronounced his vows and was regularly elected the first 
general of his new Society.
With the sweet name of Jesus on his lips and in his heart, St. Ignatius gave 
his soul to God on July 31,1556. His body is preserved in Rome in the 
magnificent church built by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and dedicated to his 
memory.
