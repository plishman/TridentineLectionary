May the kind intercessions of St. 
Ignatius be with our offerings, O Lord 
God, that the most holy mysteries, Ã­n 
which Thou hast established the 
fountain of all sanctity, may in very truth
sanctify us likewise. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
