May the sacrifice of praise, O Lord, 
which with thanksgiving we have 
offered Thee, in honor of St. Ignatius, 
bring us, by his intercession, to the 
everlasting praise of Thy majesty. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
