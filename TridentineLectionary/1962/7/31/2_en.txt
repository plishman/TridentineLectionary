Dearly beloved, be mindful that the 
Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from 
the dead, of the seed of David, 
according to my gospel. Wherein I 
labor even unto bands, as an evil-doer: 
but the word of God is not bound. 
Therefore I endure all things for the 
sake of the elect, that they may also 
obtain the salvation, which is in Christ 
Jesus, with Heavenly glory. But thou 
hast fully known my doctrine, manner 
of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, 
love patience persecutions, afflictions, 
such as came upon me at Antioch, at 
Iconium, and at Lystra; what 
persecutions I endured and out of them
all the Lord delivered me. And all that 
will live godly in Jesus Christ shall 
suffer persecution.
