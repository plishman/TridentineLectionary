For see your vocation, brethren, that 
there are not many wise according to 
the flesh, not many mighty, not many 
noble: But the foolish things of the 
world hath God chosen, that he may 
confound the wise; and the weak things
of the world hath God chosen, that he 
may confound the strong. And the 
base things of the world, and the things
that are contemptible, hath God 
chosen, and things that are not, that he
might bring to nought things that are: 
That no flesh should glory in his sight. 
But the sensual man perceiveth not 
these things that are of the Spirit of 
God; for it is foolishness to him, and he 
cannot understand, because it is 
spiritually examined.
