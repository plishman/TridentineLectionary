Lord, we offer to Thee this sacrifice of 
atonement, through which blessed 
Maria, Thy handmaiden, learned in 
early youth to offer her body as a holy 
and pleasing sacrifice to Thee. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
