Sinners lie in wait to destroy me, but I 
give heed to Thy precepts. I have seen
the end of all perfection, but Thy 
commandment is exceeding broad. 
(Ps. 118: 1) Blessed are those whose 
way is blameless, who walk in the law 
of the Lord. Glory be to the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Sinners lie in wait to destroy me, but I 
give heed to Thy precepts. I have seen
the end of all perfection, but Thy 
commandment is exceeding broad.
