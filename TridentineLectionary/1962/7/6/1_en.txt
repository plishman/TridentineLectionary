O God, who hast bestowed the victory 
of martyrdom at a young age upon Thy 
handmaiden Maria; we beseech Thee, 
who gavest the crown to the virgin in 
her struggle, grant us perseverance in 
Thy commandments through her 
patronage. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
