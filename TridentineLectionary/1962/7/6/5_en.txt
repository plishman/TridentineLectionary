At that time, Jesus said to His disciples,
The hour arrives when the Son of man 
shall be glorified. Amen, amen, I say to
you, unless the grain of wheat falls to 
the ground and dies, it remains alone. 
But if it dies, it yields much fruit. 
Whoever loves his life, will lose it. And 
whoever hates his life in this world, 
preserves it unto eternal life.
