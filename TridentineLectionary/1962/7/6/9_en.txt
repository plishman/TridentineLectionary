Refreshed by heavenly Bread, grant, 
we beseech Thee, O Lord, the same 
strength in defending the purity of body 
and soul which Thou didst wondrously 
bestow upon Thy handmaiden, Maria. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
