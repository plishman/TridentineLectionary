May the heavenly banquet at which we 
have been fed, O Lord Jesus Christ, 
set our hearts aflame with that fire of 
love with which St. Anthony Mary bore 
the banner of the saving Victim to 
victory against the enemies of Thy 
Church. Who lives and reigns with God
the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
