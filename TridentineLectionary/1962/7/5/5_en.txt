At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
Whosoever shall not receive the 
kingdom of God as a little child, shall 
not enter into it. And embracing them, 
and laying his hands upon them, he 
blessed them. And when he was gone 
forth into the way, a certain man 
running up and kneeling before him, 
asked him, Good Master, what shall I 
do that I may receive life everlasting? 
And Jesus said to him, Why callest 
thou me good? None is good but one, 
that is God. Thou knowest the 
commandments: Do not commit 
adultery, do not kill, do not steal, bear 
not false witness, do no fraud, honor 
thy father and mother. But he 
answering, said to him: Master, all 
these things I have observed from my 
youth. And Jesus looking on him, loved 
him, and said to him: One thing is 
wanting unto thee: go, sell whatsoever 
thou hast, and give to the poor, and 
thou shalt have treasure in heaven; 
and come, follow me.
