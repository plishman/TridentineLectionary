My speech and my preaching was not 
in the persuasive words of human 
wisdom, but in showing of the spirit and
power. (Ps. 110: 1) I will praise Thee, O
Lord, with my whole heart ; in the 
council of the just, and in the 
congregation. Glory be to the Father, 
and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now, and 
ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen. My speech and my preaching 
was not in the persuasive words of 
human wisdom, but in showing of the 
spirit and power.
