This famous Lombard preacher was one of that band of saints whom the 
Lord, in the Sixteenth Century, sent to carry out in Italy that ecclesiastical reform
which had indeed been long desired, but which the Canons of the Council of 
Trent alone could not effect. It was necessary that they should be put into 
practice with heroic zeal, and this could be done only by a saint. He founded 
the order of Regular Clerks who, from the Church of St. Barnabas near which 
they lived, are called "Barnabites." They gave much assistance to St. Charles 
Borromeo in his work of reform. Anthony died at the age of 36, July 5, 1539,
and was canonized by Pope Leo XIII.
