For God is my witness, how I will long 
after you all in the bowels of Jesus 
Christ. And this I pray, that your charity 
may more and more abound in 
knowledge and in all understanding. 
That you may approve the better 
things, that you may be sincere and 
without offense unto the day of Jesus 
Christ.
