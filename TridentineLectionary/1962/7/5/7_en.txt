May we bring to the table of the 
heavenly banquet, O Lord, that purity of
mind and body with which St. Anthony 
Mary was so wondrously imbued and in
which he excelled when he offered 
these sacrificial gifts. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
