Make us, O Lord God, learn, in the 
spirit of Paul the Apostle, the 
knowledge of Jesus Christ which 
surpasseth all understanding, wherein 
blessed Anthony Mary was marvelously
versed and formed in Thy Church new 
religious congregations of men and 
women. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
