O God, the author and lover of peace, 
to know Whom is to live, and to serve 
Whom is to reign, protect us Thy 
suppliants from all assaults, that we, 
who trust in Thy defense, by the 
intercession of blessed Iren«Ωus, Thy 
martyr and bishop, may not fear the 
arms of any of our foes. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
