The law of truth was in his mouth, and 
iniquity was not found in his lips: he 
walked with me in peace and in equity, 
and turned many away from iniquity. 
(Ps. 77: 1) With them that hated peace 
I was peaceful, when I spake unto 
them, they fought against me without 
cause. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
The law of truth was in his mouth, and 
iniquity was not found in his lips: he 
walked with me in peace and in equity, 
and turned many away from iniquity.
