Dearly Beloved: Continue thou in those
things which thou hast learned and 
which have been committed to thee: 
knowing of Whom thou hast learned 
them; and because from thy infancy 
thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, 
which can instruct thee to salvation by 
the faith which is in Jesus Christ. All 
Scripture, inspired by God, is profitable 
to teach, to reprove, to correct, to 
instruct in justice, that the man of God 
may be perfect, furnished to every 
good work. I charge thee, before God 
and Jesus Christ, Who shall judge the 
living and the dead by His coming, and 
His kingdom: Preach the word: be 
instant in season, out of season; 
reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience 
and doctrine. For there shall be a time 
when they shall not endure sound 
doctrine: but according to their own 
desires, they will heap to themselves 
teachers having itching ears, and will 
indeed turn away their hearing from the
truth, but will be turned unto fables. But
be thou vigilant, labor in all things, do 
the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy 
ministry.
