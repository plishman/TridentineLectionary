At that time, Jesus said to His disciples,
Fear ye not them that kill the body, and 
are not able to kill the soul; but rather 
fear him that can destroy both soul and 
body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold 
for a farthing, and not one of them shall
fall on the ground without your Father. 
But the very hairs of your head are all 
numbered. Fear not therefore: better 
are you than many sparrows. Every 
one therefore that shall confess Me 
before men, I will also confess him 
before My Father Who is in Heaven. 
But he that shall deny Me before men, I
will also deny him before My Father 
Who is in Heaven.
