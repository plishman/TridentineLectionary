O God, Who didst vouchsafe unto 
blessed Iren«Ωus, Thy martyr and 
bishop; by his strenuous teaching of 
the truth, utterly to confute heresies, 
and happily to establish peace in Thy 
Church: unto us Thy people, grant, we 
beseech Thee, to be steadfast in the 
practice of our holy religion, and in all 
our days to enjoy that peace which is 
from Thee. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
