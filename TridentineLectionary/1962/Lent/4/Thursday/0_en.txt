Let the heart of them rejoice that seek 
the Lord: seek the Lord, and be 
strengthened; seek His face evermore.
(Ps. 104: 1) Give glory to the Lord, and
call upon His name; declare His deeds 
among the gentiles. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Let the heart of them 
rejoice that seek the Lord: seek the 
Lord, and be strengthened; seek His 
face evermore.
