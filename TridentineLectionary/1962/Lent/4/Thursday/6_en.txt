Purify us, O merciful God, that the 
prayers of Thy Church, which are 
pleasing to Thee, may become the 
more pleasing from the purified hearts 
with which they bring the gifts of 
devotion. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
