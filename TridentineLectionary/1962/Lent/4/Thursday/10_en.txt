Bow your heads to God.
God, the teacher and ruler of Thy 
people, put to flight the sins that assail 
them, that they may be pleasing to 
Thee and secure in Thy protection.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
