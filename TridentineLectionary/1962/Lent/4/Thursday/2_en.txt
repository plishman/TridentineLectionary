In those days, a Sunamite woman 
came to Eliseus to Mount Carmel: and 
when the man of God saw her coming 
towards, he said to Giezi his servant: 
Behold that Sunamitess. Go therefore 
to meet her, and say to her: Is all well 
with thee, and with thy husband, and 
with thy son? And she answered: Well. 
And when she came to the man of 
God to the mount, she caught hold on 
his feet: and Giezi came to remove 
her. And the man of God said: Let her 
alone, for her soul is in anguish, and 
the Lord hath hid it from me and hath 
not told me. And she said to him: Did I 
ask a son of my Lord? Did I not say to 
thee: Do not deceive me? Then he said
to Giezi: Gird up thy loins, and take my 
staff in thy hand and go. If any man 
meet thee, salute him not; and if any 
man salute thee, answer him not; and 
lay my staff upon the face of the child. 
But the mother of the child said: As the 
Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth I will 
not leave thee. He arose, therefore, 
and followed her. But Giezi was gone 
before them, and laid the staff upon the
face of the child, and there was no 
voice nor sense; and he returned to 
meet him, and told him, saying: The 
child is not risen. Eliseus therefore 
went into the house, and behold the 
child lay dead on his bed; and going in 
he shut the door upon him, and upon 
the child, and prayed to the Lord; and 
he went up and lay upon the child: and 
he put his mouth upon his mouth, and 
his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands 
upon his hands: and he bowed himself 
upon him, and the child's flesh grew 
warm. Then he returned and walked in 
the house, once to and fro; and he 
went up, and lay upon him; and the
child gaped seven times, and opened 
his eyes. And he called Giezi, and said 
to him: Call this Sunamitess. And she 
being called, went in to him, and he 
said: Take up thy son. She came and 
fell at his feet, and worshiped upon the 
ground; and took up her son, and went 
out, and Eliseus returned to Galgal.
