Suffer not Thy heavenly gifts, we pray
Thee, O Lord, to become the occasion 
of judgment to those who receive them,
for Thou hast provided them unto the 
healing of Thy faithful. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
