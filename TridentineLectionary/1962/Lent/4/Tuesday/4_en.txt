At that time, when the feast was 
already half over, Jesus went up into 
the temple and began to teach. And the
Jews marveled, saying, How does this 
man come by learning, since He has 
not studied? Jesus answered them and
said, My teaching is not My own, but 
His Who sent Me. If anyone
desires to do His will, he will know of 
the teaching whether it is from God, or
whether I speak on My own authority. 
He who speaks on his own authority 
seeks his own glory. But he who seeks 
the glory of the one who sent him is 
truthful, and there is no injustice in him.
Did not Moses give you the Law, and 
none of you observes the Law? Why do
you seek to put Me to death?
The crowd answered and said, You 
have a devil. Who seeks to put You to 
death? Jesus answered and said to 
them, One work I did and you all 
wonder. For this reason Moses gave 
you the circumcision - not that it is from
Moses, but from the fathers - and
on a Sabbath you circumcise a man. If 
a man receives circumcision on a 
Sabbath, that the Law of Moses may 
not be broken, are you indignant with 
me because I made a whole man well 
on a Sabbath? Judge not by 
appearances but give just judgment. 
Some therefore of the people of 
Jerusalem were saying, Is not this the 
man they seek to kill? And behold, He 
speaks openly and they say nothing to 
Him. Can it be that the rulers have 
really come to know that this is the
Christ? Yet we know where this man is
from; but when the Christ comes, no 
one will know where He is from. Jesus 
therefore, while teaching in the temple,
cried out and said, You both know Me, 
and know where I am from. Yet I have 
not come of Myself, but He is true Who 
has sent Me, whom you do not know. I 
know Him because I am from Him, and 
He sent Me. They wanted therefore to 
seize Him, but no one laid hands on 
Him because His hour had not yet 
come. Many of the people, however, 
believed in Him.
