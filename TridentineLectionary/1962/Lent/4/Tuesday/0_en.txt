Hearken, O God, to my prayer; turn not
away from my pleading; give heed to 
me, and answer me. (Ps. 54: 3-4) I 
rock with grief, and am troubled at the 
voice of the enemy and the clamor of 
the wicked. Glory be to the Father, and
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Hearken, O God, to my prayer; turn not
away from my pleading; give heed to 
me, and answer me.
