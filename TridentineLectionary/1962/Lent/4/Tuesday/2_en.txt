In those days, the Lord said to Moses, 
Go down from the mountain to your 
people, whom you brought out of the 
land of Egypt, for they have become 
depraved. They have soon turned 
aside from the way I pointed out to 
them, making for themselves a molten 
calf and worshiping it, sacrificing to it 
and crying out, ‘This is your God, O 
Israel, Who brought you out of the land 
of Egypt!’ I see how stiff-necked
this people is, continued the Lord to 
Moses. Let Me alone, then, that My
wrath may blaze up against them to
consume them. Then I will make of you
a great nation. But Moses implored the 
Lord, his God, saying, Why, O Lord, 
should Thy wrath blaze up against 
Thine own people, whom Thou brought
out of the land of Egypt with such great 
power and with so strong a hand? Why 
should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil 
intent He brought them out, that He 
might kill them in the mountains and 
exterminate them from the face of the 
earth’? Let Thy blazing wrath die down;
relent in punishing Your people. 
Remember Thy servants Abraham, 
Isaac and Israel, and how Thou swore 
to them by Thine own self, saying, ‘I will
make your descendants as numerous 
as the stars in the sky; and all this land 
that I promised, I will give your 
descendants as their perpetual 
heritage.’ So the Lord relented in the 
punishment He had threatened to inflict
on His people.
