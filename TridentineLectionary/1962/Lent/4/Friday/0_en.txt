Let the thought of my heart find favor
before Thee, O Lord, my Rock and my
Redeemer. (Ps. 18: 2) The heavens 
declare the glory of God, and the 
firmament proclaims His handiwork. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Let the 
thought of my heart find favor before 
Thee, O Lord, my Rock and my 
Redeemer.
