In those days, the son of the woman, 
the mistress of the house, fell sick, and
the sickness was very grievous, so that
there was no breath left in him. And she
said to Elias, What have I to do with 
you, O man of God? Have you come to
me that my iniquities should be 
remembered, and that you should kill 
my son? And Elias said to her, Give me
your son. And he took him out of her 
bosom, and carried him into the upper 
chamber where he abode, and laid him 
upon his own bed, and he cried to the 
Lord, and said, O Lord my God, have 
Thou afflicted also the widow, with 
whom I am after a sort maintained, so 
as to kill her son? And he stretched, 
and measured himself upon the child 
three times, and cried to the Lord and 
said, O Lord my God, let the soul of this
child, I beseech Thee, return into his 
body. And the Lord heard the voice of 
Elias; and the soul of the child returned 
into him, and he revived. And Elias took
the child, and brought him down from 
the upper chamber to the house below, 
and delivered him to his mother, and 
said to her, Behold, your son lives. And 
the woman said to Elias, Now by this I 
knew that you are a man of God, and 
the word of the Lord in your mouth is 
true.
