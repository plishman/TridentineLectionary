Bow your heads to God.
Grant us, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that, conscious of our weakness, 
and confiding in Thy strength, we may 
ever rejoice under Thy kindness.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
