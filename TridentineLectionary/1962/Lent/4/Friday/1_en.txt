O God, Who dost renew the world with 
ineffable sacraments, grant, we 
beseech Thee, that Thy Church may 
both be profited by the eternal 
institutions and not left without temporal
assistance. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
