Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and come 
together all you that love her; rejoice 
with joy, you that have been in sorrow: 
that you may exult, and be filled from 
the breasts of your consolation. I 
rejoiced at the things that were said to 
me: We shall go into the house of the 
Lord. Glory be to the Father, and to the 
Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in 
the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. Rejoice, 
O Jerusalem, and come together all 
you that love her; rejoice with joy, you 
that have been in sorrow: that you may 
exult, and be filled from the breasts of 
your consolation.
