At that time, Jesus went over the Sea 
of Galilee which is that of Tiberias; and 
a great multitude followed Him, 
because they saw the miracles which 
He did on them that were diseased. 
Jesus therefore went up into a 
mountain, and there He sat with His 
disciples. Now the pasch, the festival 
day of the Jews, was near at hand. 
When Jesus therefore had lifted up His 
eyes, and seen that a very great 
multitude cometh to Him, He said to 
Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that 
these may eat? And this He said to try 
him; for He Himself knew what He 
would do. Philip answered Him, Two 
hundred penny-worth of bread is not 
sufficient for them, that every one may 
take a little. One of His disciples, 
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, 
saith to Him, There is a boy here that 
hath five barley loaves and two fishes; 
but what are these among so many? 
Then Jesus said: Make the men sit 
down. Now there was much grass in 
the place. The men therefore sat down,
in number about five thousand. And 
Jesus took the loaves; and when He 
had given thanks, He distributed to 
them that were set down. In like 
manner also of the fishes, as much as 
they would. And when they were filled, 
He said to His disciples, Gather up the 
fragments that remain, lest they be lost.
They gathered up therefore, and filled 
twelve baskets with the fragments of 
the five barley loaves, which remained 
over and above to them that had eaten.
Now those men, when they had seen 
what a miracle Jesus had done, said, 
This is of a truth the prophet that is to 
come into the world. Jesus therefore, 
when He knew that they would come to
take Him by force and make Him king, 
fled again into the mountain Himself 
alone.
