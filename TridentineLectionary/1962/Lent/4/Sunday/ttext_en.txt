Ever since the time of St. Helena, a large portion of the true cross has been 
preserved in her basilica in a theater, and for this reason the station is held there
today. Its earliest designation was Basilica Heleniana, or more commonly 
Sancta Hierusalem, whence we have the frequent allusions to Jerusalem
in today's Mass.
The Introit sounds the note of joy in the triumph of the Holy Cross; today is 
the feast of Holy Jerusalem. The Church invites us, as it were, to take a little rest
in order to recruit our strength before proceeding with renewed fervor on the 
road of penance.
The Liturgy, therefore, reminds us of how Our Lord multiplied the loaves and
the fishes in the desert, and fed five thousand persons (John 6, 1-15). That food 
represents the Word of God, which is the food of the soul; it also represents the 
material blessings with which divine Providence unfailingly sustains our human 
nature.
