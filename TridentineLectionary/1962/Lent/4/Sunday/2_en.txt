Brethren: it is written that Abraham had 
two sons; the one by a bond-woman, 
and the other by a free-woman. But he 
who was of the bond-woman was born 
according to the flesh; but he of the 
free-woman was by promise. Which 
things are said by an allegory. For 
these are the two testaments; the one 
from Mount Sina, engendering unto 
bondage, which is Agar: for Sina is a 
mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity 
to that Jerusalem which now is, and is 
in bondage with her children: but that 
Jerusalem which is above is free, which
is our mother. For it is written, Rejoice, 
thou barren that bearest not; break 
forth and cry, thou that travailest not; 
for many are the children of the 
desolate, more than of her that hath a 
husband. Now we, brethren, as Isaac 
was, are the children of promise. But as
then he that was born according to the 
flesh persecuted him that was after the 
spirit, so also it is now. But what saith 
the Scriptures?Cast out the bond-
woman and her son; for the son of the 
bond-woman shall not be heir with the 
son of the free-woman. So then, 
brethren, we are not the children of the 
bond-woman, but of the free; by the 
freedom wherewith Christ hath made 
us free.
