Grant us, we beseech Thee, O merciful
God, ever to celebrate with sincere 
worship and receive with faithful hearts 
Thy holy mysteries, of which we 
continually partake. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
