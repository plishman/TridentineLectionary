Save me, O God, by Thy name, and in 
Thy strength deliver me: O God, hear 
my prayer: give ear to the words of my 
mouth. (Ps. 53: 5) For strangers have 
risen up against me: and the mighty 
have sought after my soul. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. Save me, O God, by Thy 
name, and in Thy strength deliver me: 
O God, hear my prayer: give ear to the 
words of my mouth.
