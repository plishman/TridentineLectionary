At that time, the Pasch of the Jews was
at hand, and Jesus went up to 
Jerusalem. And he found in the temple 
them that sold oxen and sheep and 
doves, and the changers of money 
sitting. And when he had made, as it
were, a scourge of little cords, he drove
them all out of the temple, the sheep 
also and the oxen, and the money of 
the changers he poured out, and the 
tables he overthrew. And to them that 
sold doves he said: Take these things 
hence, and make not the house of my 
Father a house of traffic. And his 
disciples remembered, that it was 
written: The zeal of thy house hath 
eaten me up. The Jews, therefore, 
answered, and said to him: What sign 
dost thou shew unto us, seeing thou 
dost these things? Jesus answered, 
and said to them: Destroy this temple, 
and in three days I will raise it up. The 
Jews then said: Six and forty years was
this temple in building; and wilt thou 
raise it up in three days? But he spoke 
of the temple of his body. When 
therefore he was risen again from the 
dead, his disciples remembered, that 
he had said this, and they believed the 
scripture, and the word that Jesus
had said. Now when he was at 
Jerusalem, at the Pasch, upon the 
festival day, many believed in his 
name, seeing his signs which he did. 
But Jesus did not trust himself unto
them, for that he knew all men, And 
because he needed not that any should
give testimony of man: for he knew 
what was in man.
