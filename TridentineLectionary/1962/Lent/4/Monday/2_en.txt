In those days there came two women 
that were harlots, to the king, and stood
before him: And one of them said: I 
beseech thee, my lord, I and this 
woman dwelt in one house, and I was 
delivered of a child with her in the 
chamber. And the third day, after that I 
was delivered, she also was delivered, 
and we were together, and no other 
person with us in the house, only we
two. And this woman's child died in the
night: for in her sleep she overlaid him. 
And rising in the dead time of the night,
she took my child from my side, while I 
thy handmaid was asleep, and laid it in 
her bosom: and laid her dead child in 
my bosom. And when I rose in the 
morning to give my child suck, behold it
was dead: but considering him more 
diligently when it was clear day, I found 
that it was not mine which I bore. And 
the other woman answered: It is not so 
as thou sayest, but thy child is dead, 
and mine is alive. On the contrary she 
said: Thou liest: for my child liveth, and 
thy child is dead. And in this manner 
they strove before the king. Then said 
the king: The one saith, My child is 
alive, and thy child is dead. And the 
other answereth: Nay, but thy child is 
dead, and mine liveth. The king 
therefore said: Bring me a sword. And 
when they had brought a sword before 
the king, Divide, said he, the living child
in two, and give half to the one, and 
half to the other. But the woman whose 
child was alive, said to the king, (for
her heart was moved upon her child,) I 
beseech thee, my lord, give her the 
child alive, and do not kill it. But the 
other said: Let it be neither mine nor 
thine, but divide it. The king 
answered, and said: Give the living 
child to this woman, and let it not be
killed, for she is the mother thereof. 
And all Israel heard the judgment which
the king had judged, and they feared 
the king, seeing that the wisdom of God
was in him to do judgment.
