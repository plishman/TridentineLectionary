At that time, Jesus spoke to the 
multitudes of the Jews, saying, I am the
light of the world. He who follows Me 
does not walk in the darkness, but will 
have the light of life. The Pharisees 
therefore said to Him, You bear witness
to Yourself. Your witness is not true. 
Jesus answered and said to them, 
Even if I bear witness to Myself, My 
witness is true, because I know where I
came from and where I go. But you do 
not know where I came from or where I 
go. You judge according to the flesh; I 
judge no one. And even if I do judge, 
My judgment is true, because I am not 
alone, but with Me is He Who sent Me, 
the Father. And in your Law it is 
written that the witness of two persons 
is true. It is I Who bear witness to 
Myself, and He Who sent Me, the 
Father, bears witness to Me. They 
therefore said to Him, Where is your 
Father? Jesus answered, You know 
neither Me nor My Father. If you knew 
Me, you would then know My Father 
also. Jesus spoke these words in the 
treasury, while teaching in the temple. 
And no one seized Him, because His 
hour had not yet come.
