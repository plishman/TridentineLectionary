All you who thirst, come to the waters,
says the Lord: and you who have no
money, come and drink with joy. (Ps. 
77: 1) Hearken, My people, to My law; 
incline your ears to the words of My 
mouth. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. All 
you who thirst, come to the waters, 
says the Lord: and you who have no 
money, come and drink with joy.
