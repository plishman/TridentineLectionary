Bow your heads to God.
O God, Who would rather show mercy
than anger toward those who hope in 
Thee, make us truly sorry for the evil 
we have done, that we may be worthy 
of Thy merciful consolation. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
