This Saturday is called sitientes from the opening words of the Introit. Since 
the time of Pope Gelasius (492-496) it has been a day for conferring Holy 
Orders, and was therefore once a day of great fast, extending through the night.
The Gospel teaches us that if the house of God on earth is not to be turned 
into a house of traffickers - still less can we purchase our entrance into heaven. 
We are to drink with joy from the fountains of grace which flow from the blessed
Eucharist.
