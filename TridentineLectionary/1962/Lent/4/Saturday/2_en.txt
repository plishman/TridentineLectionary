Thus says the Lord: In a time of favor I
answer you, on the day of salvation I 
help you, to restore the land and allot 
the desolate heritages, saying to the 
prisoners: Come out! to those in 
darkness: Show yourselves! Along the 
ways they shall find pasture, on every 
bare height shall their pastures be. 
They shall not hunger or thirst, nor shall
the scorching wind or the sun strike 
them; for he who pities them leads 
them and guides them beside springs 
of water. I will cut a road through all My 
mountains, and make My highways 
level. See, some shall come from afar, 
others from the north and the west, and
some from the land of Syene. Sing out, 
O heavens, and rejoice, O earth, break 
forth into song, you mountains. For the 
Lord comforts His people and shows 
mercy to His afflicted. But Sion said, 
The Lord has forsaken me; my Lord 
has forgotten me. Can a mother forget 
her infant, be without tenderness for 
the child of her womb? Even should 
she forget, I will never forget you, says 
the Lord almighty.
