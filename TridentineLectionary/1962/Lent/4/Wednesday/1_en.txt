Thus saith the Lord God, I will sanctify 
My great name, which was profaned 
among the gentiles which you have 
profaned in the midst of them; that the 
gentiles may know that I am the lord, 
saith the Lord of hosts, when I shall be 
sanctified in you before their eyes. For I
will take you from among the gentiles, 
and will gather you together out of all 
countries, and will bring you into your 
own land; and I will pour upon you 
clean water, and you shall be cleansed 
from all your filthiness, and I will 
cleanse you from all your idols, and will
give you a new heart, and put a new 
spirit within you; and I will take away 
the stony heart out of your flesh, and 
will give you a heart of flesh. And I will 
put My spirit in the midst of you, and I 
will cause you to walk in My 
commandments, and to keep My 
judgments, and do them, and you shall 
dwell in the land which I gave to your 
fathers, and you shall be My people, 
and I will be your God; saith the Lord 
almighty.
