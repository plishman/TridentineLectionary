Thus saith the Lord God, Wash 
yourselves, be clean, take away the 
evil of your devices from My eyes; 
cease to do perversely, learn to do well;
seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, 
judge for the fatherless, defend the 
widow, and then come, and accuse Me,
saith the Lord: if your sins be as 
scarlet, they shall be made as white as 
snow: and if they be red as crimson, 
they shall be white as wool. If you be 
willing and will harken to Me, you shall 
eat the good things of the land; saith 
the Lord almighty.
