When I shall be sanctified in you, I will 
gather you from every land: and I will 
pour upon you clean water, and you 
shall be cleansed from all your 
filthiness: and I will give you a new 
spirit. (Ps. 33: 2) I will bless the Lord at 
all times: His praise shall be ever in my 
mouth. Glory be to the Father and to 
the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was
in the beginning, is now and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. When I 
shall be sanctified in you, I will gather 
you from every land: and I will pour 
upon you clean water, and you shall be
cleansed from all your filthiness: and I 
will give you a new spirit.

Let us pray. Let us kneel.

God, Who dost vouchsafe to the just 
the reward of their merits, and to 
sinners pardon through fasting, have 
mercy upon Thy suppliants, that the 
confession of our guilt may have power
to obtain for us forgiveness of our 
misdoings. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God forever and ever.
