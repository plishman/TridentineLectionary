Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we who have undertaken to 
chastise our bodies by fasting may, 
even in this devotion, find cause for 
rejoicing: for as much as earthly 
passions being thereby subdued, we 
are the better able to fix our hopes on 
the delights of Heaven. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.
