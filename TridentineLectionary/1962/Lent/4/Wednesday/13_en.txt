Bow down your heads before God.
May the ears of Thy mercy, O Lord, be 
open to the prayers of Thy suppliants, 
and, that Thou may grant their desires 
to them that seek Thee, make them to 
ask the things that are pleasing to 
Thee. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
