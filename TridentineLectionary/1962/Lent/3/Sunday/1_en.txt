Humbling ourselves before Thee, we 
beseech Thee, Almighty God, favorably
to regard the desires of our heart: and 
in our defense to stretch forth the right 
hand of Thy Majesty. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
