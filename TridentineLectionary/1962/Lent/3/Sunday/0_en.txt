My eyes are ever towards the Lord: for 
He shall pluck my feet out of the snare: 
look Thou upon me, and have mercy 
on me: for I am alone and poor. (Ps. 
24: 1, 2) To Thee, O Lord, have I lifted 
up my soul: in Thee, O my God, I put 
my trust, let me not be ashamed. Glory
be to the Father and to the Son and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. My eyes are 
ever towards the Lord: for He shall 
pluck my feet out of the snare: look 
Thou upon me, and have mercy on me:
for I am alone and poor.
