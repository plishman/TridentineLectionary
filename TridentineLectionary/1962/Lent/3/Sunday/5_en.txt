At that time Jesus was casting out a 
devil, and the same was dumb. And 
when He had cast out the devil, the 
dumb spoke, and the multitudes were 
in admiration at it. But some of them 
said: He casteth out devils by 
Beelzebub, the prince of devils. And 
others, tempting, asked of Him a sign 
from Heaven. But He, seeing their 
thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom 
divided against itself shall be brought to
desolation, and house upon house 
shall fall. And if Satan also be divided 
against himself, how shall this kingdom 
stand? Because you say that through 
Beelzebub I cast out devils. Now if I 
cast out devils by Beelzebub, by whom 
do your children cast them out? 
Therefore, they shall be your judges. 
But if I by the finger of God cast out 
devils: doubtless the kingdom of God is
come upon you. When a strong man 
armed keepeth his court, those things 
are in peace which he possesseth. But 
if a stronger than he come upon him 
and overcome him, he will take away 
all his armor wherein he trusted, and 
will distribute his spoils. He that is not 
with Me is against Me: and he that 
gathereth not with Me scattereth. When
the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, 
he walketh through places without 
water, seeking rest: and not finding, he 
saith: I will return into my house 
whence I came out. And when he is 
come, he findeth it swept and 
garnished. Then he goeth and taketh 
with him seven other spirits more 
wicked than himself, and entering in 
they dwell there. And the last state of 
that man becomes worse than the first. 
And it came to pass, as He spoke 
these things, a certain woman from the 
crowd, lifting up her voice, said to Him: 
Blessed is the womb that bore Thee, 
and the paps that gave Thee suck. But 
He said: Yea, rather, blessed are they 
who hear the word of God, and keep it.
