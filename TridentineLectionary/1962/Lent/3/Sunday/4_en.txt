To Thee have I lifted up my eyes, Who 
dwellest in heaven. Behold as the eyes
of servants are on the hands of their 
masters. And as the eyes of the 
handmaid are on the hands of her 
mistress: so are our eyes unto the Lord
our God, until He have mercy on us. 
Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy
on us.
