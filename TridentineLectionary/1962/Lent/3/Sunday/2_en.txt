Brethren: Be ye followers of God, as 
most dear children: and walk in love, as
Christ also hath loved us, and hath 
delivered Himself for us, an oblation 
and a sacrifice to God for an odor of 
sweetness. But fornication, and all 
uncleanness or covetousness, let it not 
so much as be named among you, as 
becometh saints: or obscenity, or 
foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to 
no purpose: but rather giving of thanks.
For know you this, and understand, that
no fornicator, or unclean or covetous 
person, which is a serving of idols, hath
inheritance in the kingdom of Christ 
and of God. Let no man deceive you 
with vain words: for because of these 
things cometh the anger of God upon 
the children of unbelief. Be ye not 
therefore partakers with them. For you 
were heretofore darkness: but now light
in the Lord. Walk then as children of 
the light: for the fruit of the light is in all 
goodness, and justice, and truth.
