In the Epistle to the Ephesians read as the Lesson for today, St. Paul 
speaks very appropriately of the divine light and its fruits, which are first 
described in their negative aspect, when he warns his hearers against sensual 
pleasures, evil-speaking, and covetousness, and then in their positive aspect: 
goodness, and justice, and truth.
The Church celebrates her solemn stations in the sanctuaries of the martyrs
in order to remind us that we are the heirs of their spiritual patrimony. Their 
blood cemented the first Christian edifice, and we, as children of the martyrs, 
possess their sepulchers and the places sanctified by their confession, 
inasmuch as we succeed them in the profession of the same faith.
