At that time, Jesus said to the 
Pharisees: You will surely quote me 
this proverb, ‘Physician, cure Yourself! 
Whatever things we have heard of as 
done in Capharnaum, do here also in 
Your own country!’ But He said, Amen I 
say to you, no prophet is acceptable
in his own country. In truth I say to you, 
there were many widows in Israel in the
days of Elias, when heaven was shut 
up for three years and six months, and
a great famine came over all the land; 
and to none of them was Elias sent, but
rather to a widowed woman in Sarepta 
of Sidon. And there were many lepers 
in Israel in the time of Eliseus the 
prophet; and not one of them was 
cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian. 
And all in the synagogue, as they 
heard these things, were filled with 
wrath. And they rose up and put Him 
forth out of the town, and led His to the 
brow of the hill, on which their town 
was built, that they might throw Him 
down headlong. But He, passing 
through their midst, went His way.
