In God I will praise the word, in the 
Lord I will praise His speech, in God I 
will trust, I will not fear what man can 
do to me. (Ps. 55: 2) Have mercy on 
me, O God, for man hath trodden me 
under foot: all the day long he hath 
afflicted me, fighting against me. Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. In God I will 
praise the word, in the Lord I will praise
His speech, in God I will trust, I will not 
fear what man can do to me.
