Bow your heads to God.
Stretch forth to Thy faithful, O Lord, the 
right hand of Thy heavenly aid, that 
they may seek Thee with all their 
hearts, and may be worthy to obtain 
what they ask. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
