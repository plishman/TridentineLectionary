Give ear, O Lord, to my words, 
understand my cry: harken to the voice
of my prayer, O my King and my God. 
(Ps. 5: 4) For to Thee will I pray: O 
Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear 
my voice. Glory be to the Father, and to
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Give ear, O Lord, to my words, 
understand my cry: harken to the voice
of my prayer, O my King and my God.
