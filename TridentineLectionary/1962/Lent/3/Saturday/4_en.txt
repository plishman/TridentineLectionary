At that time, Jesus went to the Mount of
Olives. And at daybreak He came again
into the temple, and all the people 
came to Him; and sitting down He 
began to teach them. Now the Scribes 
and Pharisees brought a woman 
caught in adultery, and setting her in 
the midst, said to Him, Master,
this woman has just now been caught 
in adultery. And in the Law Moses 
commanded us to stone such persons. 
What, therefore, do You say? Now they
were saying this to test Him, in order 
that they might be able to accuse Him. 
But Jesus, stooping down, began to 
write with His finger on the ground. But 
when they continued asking Him, He 
raised Himself and said to them, Let 
him who is without sin among you be 
the first to cast a stone at her. And 
again stooping down, He began to 
write on the ground. But hearing this, 
they went away, one by one, beginning 
with the eldest. And Jesus remained 
alone, with the woman standing in the 
midst. And Jesus, raising Himself, said 
to her, Woman, where are they? Has 
no one condemned you? She said, No 
one, Lord. Then Jesus said, Neither will
I condemn you. Go your way, and
from now on sin no more.
