At that time, the scribes and pharisees 
came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
Why do Thy disciples transgress the 
tradition of the ancients? for they wash 
not their hands when they eat bread. 
But He answering, said to them, Why 
do you also transgress the 
commandment of God for your 
tradition? For God said, Honor thy 
father and mother; and he that shall 
curse father or mother, let him die the 
death. But you say, Whosoever shall 
say to father or mother, The gift 
whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall 
profit thee; and he shall not honor his 
father or his mother: and you have 
made void the commandment of God 
for your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well 
hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying, 
This people honoreth Me with their lips,
but their heart is far from Me; and in 
vain do they worship Me, teaching 
doctrines and commandments of men. 
And having called together the 
multitudes unto Him, He said to them, 
Hear ye and understand: not that which
goeth into the mouth defileth a man, 
but what cometh out of the mouth, this 
def√¨leth a man. Then came His 
disciples and said to Him, Dost Thou 
know that the pharisees, when they 
heard this word were scandalized? But 
He answering, said, Every plant which 
My heavenly Father hath not planted 
shall be rooted up. Let them alone, they
are blind and leaders of the blind; and if
the blind lead the blind, both fall into 
the pit. And Peter, answering, said to 
Him: Expound to us this parable. But 
He said, Are you also yet without 
understanding? do you not 
understand, that whatsoever entereth 
into the mouth goeth into the belly, and 
is cast into the privy? but the things 
which proceed out of the mouth come 
forth from the heart, and those things 
defile a man: for from the heart proceed
evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, 
fornications, thefts, false testimonies, 
blasphemies. These are the things that 
defile a man: but to eat with unwashed 
hands doth not defile a man.
