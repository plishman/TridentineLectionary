Thus saith the Lord God, Honor thy 
father and thy mother, that thou mayest
be long-lived upon the land which the 
Lord thy God will give thee. Thou shalt 
not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not 
bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's 
house; neither shalt thou desire his 
wife, nor his servant, nor his handmaid,
nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything 
that is his. And all the people saw the 
voices, and the flames, and the sound 
of the trumpet, and the mount smoking:
and being terrified and struck with fear, 
they stood afar off, saying to Moses, 
Speak thou to us, and we will hear; let 
not the Lord speak to us, lest we die. 
And Moses said to the people, Fear 
not, for God is come to prove you, and 
that the dread of Him might be in you, 
and you should not sin. And the people 
stood afar off', but Moses went to the 
dark cloud wherein God was: and the 
Lord said to Moses, Thus shalt thou 
say to the children of Israel, You have 
seen that I have spoken to you from 
heaven. You shall not make gods of 
silver, nor shall you make to yourselves
gods of gold. You shall make an altar of
earth unto Me, and you shall offer upon
it your holocausts and peace offerings, 
your sheep and oxen, in every place 
where the memory of My name shall 
be.
