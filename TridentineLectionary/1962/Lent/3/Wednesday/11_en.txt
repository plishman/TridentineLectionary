Bow your heads to God.
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that we who seek the grace of 
Thy protection, delivered from all evils, 
may serve Thee with untroubled minds.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
