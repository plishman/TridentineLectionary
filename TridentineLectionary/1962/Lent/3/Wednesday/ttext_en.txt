In ancient times the scrutiny of the catechumens who wished to be admitted
to holy baptism on Easter Eve began today. The Mass, therefore, has a 
distinctly catechetical character, especially in the Lesson and the Gospel.
The Communion speaks of the ways of life; the way of the cross, of the 
sepulcher, and of the descent into Limbo, by which Christ passed to the glory of 
the Resurrection.
