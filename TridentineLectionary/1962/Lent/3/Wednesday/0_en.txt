But I will hope in the Lord: I will be glad,
and rejoice in Thy mercy; for Thou hast
regarded my humility. (Ps. 30: 2) In 
Thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me 
never be confounded: deliver me in Thy
justice, and rescue me. Glory be to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. But I will hope in the Lord: 
I will be glad, and rejoice in Thy mercy; 
for Thou hast regarded my humility.
