At that time, Jesus said to His 
disciples: If your brother sin against 
you, go and show him his fault, 
between you and him alone. If he 
listen to you, you have won your 
brother. But if he do not listen to you, 
take with you one or two more so that 
on the word of two or three witnesses 
every word may be confirmed. And if he
refuse to hear them, appeal to the 
Church, but if he refuse to hear even 
the Church, let him be to you as the 
heathen and the publican. Amen I say 
to you, whatever you bind on earth 
shall be bound also in heaven; and 
whatever you loose on earth shall be 
loosed also in heaven. I say to you 
further, that if two of you shall agree on 
earth about anything at all for which 
they ask, it shall be done for them by 
My Father in heaven. For where two or 
three are gathered together for My 
sake, there am I in the midst of them. 
Then Peter came up to Him and said, 
Lord, how often shall my brother sin 
against me, and I forgive him? Up to 
seven times? Jesus said to him, I do 
not say to you seven times, but seventy
times seven.
