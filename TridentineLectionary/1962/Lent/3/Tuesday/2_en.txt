In those days, a certain woman cried to
the Prophet Eliseus, saying, Your 
servant, my husband, is dead, and you 
know that your servant was one who 
feared God: and behold the creditor is 
come to take away my two sons to 
serve him. And Eliseus said to her, 
What will you have me to do for you? 
Tell me, what have you in your
house? And she answered, I your
handmaid have nothing in my house 
but a little oil, to anoint me. And he said
to her, Go, borrow of all your neighbors 
empty vessels not a few. And go in, and
shut your door, when you are within, 
and your sons; and pour out thereof 
into all those vessels: and when they 
are full take them away. So the woman 
went, and shut the door upon her, and 
upon her sons: they brought her the 
vessels, and she poured in. And when 
the vessels were full, and she said to 
her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he 
answered, I have no more. And the oil 
stood. And she came, and told the man
of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, 
and pay your creditor; and you and 
your sons live off the rest.
