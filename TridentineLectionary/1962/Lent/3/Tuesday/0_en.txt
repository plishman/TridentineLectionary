I call upon Thee, for Thou will answer 
me, O God; incline Your ear to me; 
hear my word. Keep me, O Lord, as the
apple of Thine eye; hide me in the 
shadow of Thy wings. (Ps. 16: 1) Hear,
O Lord, a just suit; attend to my outcry. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. I Call upon 
Thee, for Thou will answer me, O God; 
incline Your ear to me; hear my word. 
Keep me, O Lord, as the apple of Thine
eye; hide me in the shadow of Thy 
wings.
