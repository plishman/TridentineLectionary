May the blessed feast of Thy Saints, 
Cosmas and Damian, magnify Thee, O 
Lord, for on this day Thou didst, in 
Thine ineffable providence, confer on 
them everlasting glory, and on us the 
resource of their help. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
