At that time, Jesus, rising up out of the
synagogue, went into Simon's house: 
and Simon's wife's mother was taken 
with a great fever, and they besought 
Him for her. And standing over her, He 
commanded the fever, and it left her: 
and immediately rising, she ministered 
to them. And when the sun was down, 
all they that had any sick
with divers diseases, brought them to 
Him: but He laying His hands on every 
one of them, healed them. And devils 
went out from many, crying out, and 
saying: Thou art the Son of God. And 
rebuking them, He suffered them not to
speak, for they knew that He was 
Christ. And when it was day, going out 
He went into a desert place;
and the multitudes sought Him, and 
came unto Him; and they stayed Him 
that He should not depart from them. 
To whom He said: To other cities also I 
must preach the kingdom of God, for 
therefore am I sent. And He was 
preaching in the synagogues
of Galilee.
