I am the salvation of the people, saith 
the Lord: from whatever tribulation they
shall cry to Me, I will hear them; and I 
will be their Lord forever. (Ps. 77: 1) 
Attend, O My people, to My law; incline 
your ear to the words of My mouth. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. I am the 
salvation of the people, saith the Lord: 
from whatever tribulation they shall cry 
to Me, I will hear them; and I will be 
their Lord forever.
