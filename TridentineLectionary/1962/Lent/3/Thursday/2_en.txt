In those days, the word of the Lord 
came to me, saying: Stand in the gate 
of the house of the Lord; and proclaim 
there this word, and say: Hear ye the 
word of the Lord, all ye men of Juda, 
that enter in at these gates, to adore 
the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, 
the God of Israel: Make your ways and 
your doings good; and I will dwell with 
you in this place. Trust not in lying 
words, saying: The temple of the Lord, 
the temple of the Lord, it is the temple 
of the Lord. For if you will order well 
your ways and your doings; if you will
execute judgment between a man and 
his neighbor; if you oppress not the 
stranger, the fatherless, and the 
widow, and shed not innocent blood in 
this place, and walk not after strange 
gods to your own hurt; I will dwell with 
you in this place; in the land which I 
gave to your fathers from the 
beginning, and forevermore: saith the 
Lord almighty.
