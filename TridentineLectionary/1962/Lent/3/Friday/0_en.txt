Show me, O Lord, a token for good: 
that they who hate me may see, and be
confounded because Thou, O Lord, 
have helped me and consoled me. 
(Ps. 85: 1) Incline Thy ear, O Lord, and 
hear me: for I am needy and poor. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Show me, O
Lord, a token for good: that they who 
hate me may see, and be confounded 
because Thou, O Lord, have helped 
me and consoled me.
