In those days, the Israelites held a 
council against Moses and Aaron. The 
people contended, exclaiming, Give us 
water that we may drink. But Moses 
and Aaron went away from the 
assembly to the entrance of the 
Meeting Tent, where they fell prostrate.
They cried to the Lord, and said, O 
Lord God, hear the cry of this people, 
and open to them Your treasure, a 
fountain of living water, that being 
satisfied, they may cease to murmur. 
Then the glory of the Lord appeared to 
them, and the Lord said to Moses, Take
the staff and assemble the people, you 
and your brother Aaron, and in their 
presence order the rock to yield its 
waters. From the rock you shall bring 
forth water for the community and their 
livestock to drink. So Moses took the 
staff from its place before the Lord, as 
he was ordered. He and Aaron 
assembled the community in front of 
the rock, where he said to them, Listen 
to me, you rebels! Are we to bring 
water for you out of this rock? Then, 
raising his hand, Moses struck the rock 
twice with his staff, and water gushed 
out in abundance for the people and 
their livestock to drink. But the Lord 
said to Moses and Aaron, Because you
were not faithful to Me in showing forth 
My sanctity before the Israelites, you 
shall not lead this people into the land I
will give them. This is the water of 
contradiction, where the Israelites 
contended against the Lord, and where
He revealed His sanctity among them.
