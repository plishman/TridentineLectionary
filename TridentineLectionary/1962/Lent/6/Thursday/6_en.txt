We beseech Thee, O holy Lord, Father 
almighty, everlasting God, that He 
Himself may render our Sacrifice 
acceptable to Thee, Who, by the 
tradition of today, taught His disciples 
to do this in remembrance of Him, 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
