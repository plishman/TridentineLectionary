Before the festival-day of the Pasch, 
Jesus knowing that His hour was 
come, that He should pass out of this 
world to the Father, having loved His 
own who were in the world. He loved 
them unto the end. And when supper 
was done (the devil having now put into
the heart of Judas, the son of Simon 
the Iscariot, to betray Him), knowing 
that the Father had given Him all things
into His hands and that He came from 
God and goeth to God: He riseth from 
supper and layeth aside His garments 
and, having taken a towel, girded 
Himself. After that, He putteth water 
into a basin and began to wash the feet
of the disciples and to wipe them with 
the towel wherewith He was girded. He
cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And 
Peter saith to Him: Lord, dost Thou 
wash my feet? Jesus answered and 
said to him: What I do, thou knowest 
not now: but thou shalt know hereafter. 
Peter saith to Him: Thou shalt never 
wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I 
wash thee not, thou shalt have no part 
with Me. Simon Peter saith to Him: 
Lord, not only my feet, but also my 
hands and my head. Jesus saith to 
him: He that is washed needeth not but
to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. 
And you are clean, but not all. For He 
knew who he was that would betray 
Him; therefore He said: You are not all 
clean. Then after He had washed their 
feet and taken His garments, being set 
down again, He said to them: Know 
you what I have done to you? You call 
Me Master and Lord. And you say well; 
for so I am. If then I being your Lord 
and Master, have washed your feet, 
you also ought to wash one another's 
feet. For I have given you an example, 
that as I have done to you, so you do 
also.
