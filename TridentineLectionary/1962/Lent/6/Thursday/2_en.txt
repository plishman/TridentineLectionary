Brethren: When you come therefore
together into one place, it is not now to 
eat the Lord's supper. For every one 
taketh before his own supper to eat. 
And one indeed is hungry and another 
is drunk. What, have you not houses to
eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the 
church of God and put them to shame 
that have not? What shall I say to you?
Do I praise you? In this I praise you 
not. For I have received of the Lord that
which I also delivered unto you, that the
Lord Jesus, the same night in which He
was betrayed, took bread, and giving 
thanks, broke and said: Take ye and 
eat: This is My Body, which shall be 
delivered for you. This do for the 
commemoration of Me. In like manner 
also the chalice, after He had supped, 
saying: This chalice is the new 
testament in My Blood. This do ye, as 
often as you shall drink, for the 
commemoration of Me. For as often as 
you shall eat this bread and drink the 
chalice, you shall show the death of the
Lord, until He come. Therefore, 
whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink
the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall 
be guilty of the Body and the Blood of 
the Lord. But let a man prove himself; 
and so let him eat of that bread and 
drink of the chalice. For he that eateth 
and drinketh unworthily eateth and 
drinketh judgment to himself, not 
discerning the Body of the Lord. 
Therefore are there many infirm and 
weak among you: and many sleep. But 
if we would judge ourselves, we should 
not be judged. But whilst we are 
judged, we are chastised by the Lord, 
that we be not condemned with this 
world.
