O God, from whom Judas received the
punishment of his guilt, and the thief 
the reward of his confession, grant us 
the effect of Thy clemency; that even 
as in His passion our Lord Jesus Christ
gave to each a different recompense 
according to his merits, so may He 
deliver us from our old sins and grant 
us the grace of His Resurrection. 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
