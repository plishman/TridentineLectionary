We therefore beseech Thee, O Lord, 
graciously to accept this offering of our 
service, and that of Thy whole family, 
which we make to Thee in memory of 
the day on which our Lord Jesus Christ 
gave to His disciples the Mysteries of 
His Body and Blood to be celebrated; 
and to dispose our day in Thy peace 
preserve us from eternal damnation, 
and rank us in the number of Thine 
Elect. Through the same Christ our 
Lord. Amen.
