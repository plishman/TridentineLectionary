But it behooves us to glory in the cross 
of our Lord Jesus Christ: in Whom is 
our salvation, life, and resurrection: by 
Whom we are saved and delivered. 
(Ps. 66: 2) May God have mercy on us,
and bless us: may He cause the light of
His countenance to shine upon us; and
may He have mercy on us. But it 
behooves us to glory in the cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ: in Whom is our 
salvation, life, and resurrection: by 
Whom we are saved and delivered.
