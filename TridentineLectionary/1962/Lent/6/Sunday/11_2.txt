(If the palms were blessed immediately
before this Mass, the celebrant, at the 
end of Mass, having given the blessing
as usual, omits the Last Gospel and all 
return to the sacristy. 
<br>
In other Masses without the blessing of
palms, at the end of Mass the following
Last Gospel is said as in the blessing 
of the palms.)
