Almighty and everlasting God, by 
whose ordinance our Savior took flesh 
and suffered crucifixion to give mankind
a pattern of humility, grant us this boon,
that, with the lesson of His endurance 
before us, we may be found worthy to 
have fellowship in His resurrection: 
Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, our Lord, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
