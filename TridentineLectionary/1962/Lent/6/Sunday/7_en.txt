Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, that 
the offering made in the presence of 
Thy majesty may both obtain for us the 
grace of devotion, and secure for us 
the effect of a blessed eternity. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
