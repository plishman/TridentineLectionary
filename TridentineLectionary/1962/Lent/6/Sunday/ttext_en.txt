The Mass begins (with the Introit â€“ no Prayers at the Foot) upon the return 
of the procession; it dwells chiefly upon the sufferings of the Redeemer, His 
humiliations and sorrows, though not unmindful of His glorious resurrection.
This week was called "paschal" week because the sacred Liturgy in these 
last days of Lent does not separate the remembrance of the Savior's Passion 
from that of His triumphant resurrection. The Collect expresses this in beautiful
words. The remembrance of the sufferings endured for our sake by Jesus 
Christ should be constantly revived in our hearts, that it may awaken in them 
those feelings of love and gratitude of which St. Paul speaks: "Christ has loved 
me, and has given Himself for me. I live, but it is no more I who live, it is Christ 
who liveth in me. I live in His faith."
