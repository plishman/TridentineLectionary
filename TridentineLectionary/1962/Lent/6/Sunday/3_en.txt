Thou dost hold me by my right hand: 
Thine to lead me in a way of Thy own 
choosing, Thine to take me up to 
Thyself in glory. What bounty God 
shows to Israel, to all upright hearts! 
Yet I came near to losing my foothold, 
and felt the ground sink under my 
steps, so indignant was I over the good
fortune of the sinners that flout His law.
