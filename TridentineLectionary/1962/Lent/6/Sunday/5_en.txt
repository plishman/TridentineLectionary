Then Jesus came with them into a 
country place which is called 
Gethsemani; and He said to His 
disciples: <i>J.</i> Sit you here, till I go yonder
and pray. <i>C.</i> And taking with Him Peter 
and the two sons of Zebedee, He 
began to grow sorrowful and to be sad. 
Then He saith to them: <i>J.</i> My soul is 
sorrowful even unto death; stay you 
here and watch with Me. <i>C.</i> And going 
a little further, He fell upon His face, 
praying and saying: <i>J.</i> My Father, if it 
be possible, let this chalice pass from 
Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as 
Thou wilt. <i>C.</i> And He cometh to His 
disciples, and findeth them asleep. And
He saith to Peter: <i>J.</i> What! Could you 
not watch one hour with Me? Watch ye,
and pray that ye enter not into 
temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, 
but the flesh is weak. <i>C.</i> Again the 
second time, He went and prayed, 
saying: <i>J.</i> My Father, if this chalice may
not pass away, but I must drink it, Thy 
will be done. <i>C.</i> And He cometh again, 
and findeth them sleeping, for their 
eyes were heavy. And leaving them, He
went again and He prayed the third 
time, saying the self-same word. Then 
He cometh to His disciples, and saith to
them: <i>J.</i> Sleep ye now and take your 
rest; behold, the hour is at hand, and 
the Son of Man shall be betrayed into 
the hands of sinners. Rise, let us go; 
behold, he is at hand that will betray 
Me. <i>C.</i> As He yet spoke, behold Judas, 
one of the twelve, came, and with him a
great multitude with swords and clubs, 
sent from the chief priests and the 
ancients of the people. And he that 
betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying:
S. Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is He; 
hold Him fast. <i>C.</i> And forthwith coming 
to Jesus, he said: S. Hail, Rabbi. <i>C.</i> 
And he kissed Him. And Jesus said to 
him: <i>J.</i> Friend, whereto art thou come? 
C. Then they came up and laid hands 
on Jesus, and held Him. And behold 
one of them that were with Jesus, 
stretching forth his hand, drew out his 
sword, and striking the servant of the 
high priest, cut off his ear. Then Jesus 
saith to him: <i>J.</i> Put up again thy sword 
into its place; for all that take the sword 
shall perish with the sword. Thinkest 
thou that I cannot ask My Father, and 
He will give Me presently more than 
twelve legions of Angels? How then 
shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that so 
it must be done? <i>C.</i> In that same hour 
Jesus said to the multitudes: <i>J.</i> You are
come out, as it were to a robber, with 
swords and clubs to apprehend Me. I 
sat daily with you, teaching in the 
temple, and you laid not hands on Me. 
C. Now all this was done that the 
Scriptures of the prophets might be 
fulfilled. Then the disciples, all leaving 
Him, fled. But they holding Jesus led 
Him to Caiphas the high priest, where 
the scribes and the ancients were 
assembled. And Peter followed Him 
afar off, even to the court of the high 
priest. And going in, he sat with the 
servants, that he might see the end. 
And the chief priests and the whole 
council sought false witness against 
Jesus, that they might put Him to 
death. And they found none, whereas 
many false witnesses had come in. And
last of all there came two false 
witnesses; and they said: This man 
said, I am able to destroy the temple of 
God, and after three days to rebuild it. 
And the high priest, rising up, said to 
Him: S. Answerest Thou nothing to the 
things which these witness against 
Thee? <i>C.</i> But Jesus held His peace. 
And the high priest said to Him: S. I 
adjure Thee by the living God, that 
Thou tell us if Thou be the Christ the 
Son of God. <i>C.</i> Jesus saith to him: <i>J.</i> 
Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to 
you, hereafter you shall see the Son of 
Man sitting on the right hand of the 
power of God, and coming in the 
clouds of heaven. <i>C.</i> Then the high 
priest rent his garments, saying: S. He 
hath blasphemed; what further need 
have we of witnesses? Behold, now 
you have heard the blasphemy. What 
think you? <i>C.</i> But they answering, said: 
S. He is guilty of death. <i>C.</i> Then they 
did spit in His face and buffeted Him; 
and others struck His face with the 
palms of their hands, saying: S. 
Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he 
that struck Thee? <i>C.</i> But Peter sat 
without in the court, and there came to 
him a servant maid, saying: S. Thou 
also wast with Jesus the Galilean. <i>C.</i> 
But he denied it before them all, saying:
S. I know not what thou sayest. <i>C.</i> And 
as he went out of the gate, another 
maid saw him, and she saith to them 
that were there: S. This man also was 
with Jesus of Nazareth. <i>C.</i> And again 
he denied it with an oath: S. I know not 
the man. <i>C.</i> And after a little while, they
came that stood by and said to Peter: 
S. Surely thou also art one of them; for 
even thy speech doth discover thee. <i>C.</i> 
Then he began to curse and to swear 
that he knew not the man; and 
immediately the cock crew. And Peter 
remembered the words of Jesus which 
He had said: Before the cock crow, 
thou wilt deny Me thrice. And going 
forth, he wept bitterly. And when 
morning was come, all the chief priests 
and ancients of the people took 
counsel against Jesus, that they might 
put Him to death. And they brought Him
bound, and delivered Him to Pontius 
Pilate the governor. Then Judas, who 
betrayed Him, seeing that He was 
condemned, repenting himself, brought
back the thirty pieces of silver to the 
chief priests and ancients, saying: S. I 
have sinned in betraying innocent 
blood. <i>C.</i> But they said: S. What is that 
to us? Look thou to it. <i>C.</i> And casting 
down the pieces of silver in the temple, 
he departed, and went and hanged 
himself with a halter. But the chief 
priests having taken the pieces of 
silver, said: S. It is not lawful to put 
them into the corbona, because it is the
price of blood. And after they had 
consulted together, they bought with 
them the potter's field, to be a burying-
place for strangers. For this cause that 
field was called Haceldama, that is, the 
field of blood, even to this day. Then 
was fulfilled that which was spoken by 
Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they 
took the thirty pieces of silver, the price 
of Him that was prized, whom they 
prized of the children of Israel: and they
gave them unto the potter's field, as the
Lord appointed to me. And Jesus stood
before the governor, and the governor 
asked Him, saying: S.Art Thou the King
of the Jews? <i>C.</i> Jesus saith to him: <i>J.</i> 
Thou sayest it. <i>C.</i> And when He was 
accused by the chief priests and 
ancients, He answered nothing. Then 
Pilate saith to Him: S. Dost not Thou 
hear how great testimonies they allege 
against Thee? <i>C.</i> And He answered to 
him never a word, so that the governor 
wondered exceedingly. Now upon the 
solemn day the governor was 
accustomed to release to the people 
one prisoner, whom they would. And he
had then a notorious prisoner that was 
called Barabbas. They therefore being 
gathered together, Pilate said: S. 
Whom will you that I release to you: 
Barabbas, or Jesus that is called 
Christ? <i>C.</i> For he knew that for envy 
they had delivered Him. And as he was 
sitting in the place of judgment his wife 
sent to him, saying: S. Have thou 
nothing to do with that just man, for I 
have suffered many things this day in a
dream because of Him. <i>C.</i> But the chief
priests and ancients persuaded the 
people that they should ask Barabbas, 
and make Jesus away. And the 
governor answering, said to them: S. 
Whither will you of the two to be 
released unto you? <i>C.</i> But they said: S.
Barabbas. <i>C.</i> Pilate saith to them: S. 
What shall I do then with Jesus that is 
called Christ? <i>C.</i> They all call: S. Let 
Him be crucified. <i>C.</i> The governor said 
to them: S. Why, what evil hath He 
done? <i>C.</i> But they cried out the more, 
saying: S. Let Him be crucified. <i>C.</i> And 
Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, 
but that rather a tumult was made, 
taking water washed his hands before 
the people, saying: S. I am innocent of 
the blood of this just man; look you to it.
C. And the whole people answering, 
said: S. His blood be upon us and upon
our children. <i>C.</i> Then he released to 
them Barabbas, and having scourged 
Jesus, delivered Him unto them to be 
crucified. Then the soldiers of the 
governor, taking Jesus into the hall, 
gathered together unto Him the whole 
band; and stripping Him they put a 
scarlet cloak about Him. And platting a 
crown of thorns they put it upon His 
head and a reed in His right hand. And 
bowing the knee before Him, they 
mocked Him, saying: S. Hail, King of 
the Jews. <i>C.</i> And spitting upon Him, 
they took the reed and struck His head.
And after they had mocked Him, they 
took off the cloak from Him, and put on 
Him His own garments, and led Him 
away to crucify Him. And going out, 
they found a man of Cyrene, named 
Simon; him they forced to take up His 
cross. And they came to the place that 
is called Golgotha, which is, the place 
of Calvary. And they gave Him wine to 
drink mingled with gall; and when He 
had tasted He would not drink. And 
after they had crucified Him, they 
divided His garments, casting lots; that 
it might be fulfilled which was spoken 
by the prophet, saying: They divided 
My garments among them, and upon 
my vesture they cast lots. And they sat 
and watched Him. And they put over 
His head His cause written: This is 
Jesus the King of the Jews. Then were 
crucified with Him two thieves; one on 
the right hand and one on the left. And 
they that passed by blasphemed Him, 
wagging their heads, and saying: S. 
Vah, Thou that destroyest the temple of
God and in three days dost rebuild it, 
save Thine own self. If Thou be the 
Son of God, come down from the 
cross. <i>C.</i> In like manner also the chief 
priests with the scribes and ancients, 
mocking, said: S. He saved others, 
Himself He cannot save; if He be the 
king of Israel, let Him now come down 
from the cross, and we will believe Him;
He trusted in God, let Him now deliver 
Him if He will have Him; for He said: I 
am the Son of God. <i>C.</i> And the self-
same thing the thieves also that were 
crucified with Him reproached Him with.
Now from the sixth hour there was a 
darkness over the whole earth, until the
ninth hour. And about the ninth hour, 
Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 
saying: <i>J.</i> Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? 
C. That is: <i>J.</i> My God, My God, why 
hast Thou forsaken Me? <i>C.</i> And some 
that stood there and heard said: S. This
man calleth Elias. <i>C.</i> And immediately 
one of them running took a sponge and
filled it with vinegar and and gave Him 
to drink. And the others said: S. Let be; 
let us see whether Elias will come to 
deliver Him. <i>C.</i> And Jesus again crying 
with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
<i>(Here all kneel and pause for a few 
moments.)</i>
And behold the veil of the temple was 
rent in two from top even to the bottom;
and the earth quaked and the rocks 
were rent; and the graves were 
opened, and many bodies of the saints 
that had slept arose, and coming out of 
the tombs after His resurrection, came 
into the holy city, and appeared to 
many. Now the centurion and they that 
were with him watching Jesus, having 
seen the earthquake and the things 
that were done, were sore afraid, 
saying: S. Indeed this was the Son of 
God. <i>C.</i> And there were there many 
women afar off, who had followed 
Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto 
Him: among whom was Mary 
Magdalen, and Mary the mother of 
James and Joseph, and the mother of 
the sons of Zebedee. And when it was 
evening, there came a certain rich man 
of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also 
himself was a disciple of Jesus. He 
went to Pilate and asked the body of 
Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that 
the body should be delivered. And 
Joseph taking the body wrapt it up in a 
clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own 
new monument, which he had hewed 
out in a rock. And he rolled a great 
stone to the door of the monument and 
went his way.
