In the blessing of the palms we have an ancient type of the liturgical 
“synaxes,” or gatherings, for the recitation of the Divine Office, the instruction of 
the faithful, and prayer, which were not followed by the celebration of Mass. This
type of synaxis, taken from the Jewish rite used in the synagogues of the 
Dispersion, formed part of the Christian ritual from the time of the Apostles.
The great ceremonies of Holy Week took place in the ancient pontifical 
residence in the Lateran Palace. After the palms were blessed, they were 
carried to the chapel of St. Sylvester and distributed. The Mass was sung in the 
Basilica of the Savior.
