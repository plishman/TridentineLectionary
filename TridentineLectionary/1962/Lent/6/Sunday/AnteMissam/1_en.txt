The continuation of the holy Gospel 
according to Matthew:
At that time, when Jesus drew nigh to 
Jerusalem, and was come to 
Bethphage, unto Mount Olivet, then He 
sent two disciples, saying to them: "Go 
ye into the village that is over against 
you, and immediately you shall find an 
ass tied, and a colt with her; loose them
and bring them to Me; and if any man 
shall say anything to you, say ye that 
the Lord hath need of them; and 
forthwith he will let them go." Now all 
this was done that it might be fulfilled 
which was spoken by the prophet, 
saying: Tell ye the daughter of Sion: 
Behold thy King cometh to thee meek, 
and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the 
foal of her that is used to the yoke. And 
the disciples going did as Jesus 
commanded them. And they brought 
the ass and the colt, and laid their 
garments upon them, and made Him sit
thereon. And a very great multitude 
spread their garments in the way, and 
others cut boughs from the trees, and 
strewed them in the way, and the 
multitudes that went before and that 
followed cried, saying: Hosanna to the 
Son of David; Blessed is He that 
cometh in the Name of the Lord.
<br><br>
Let us go forth in peace.
In the name of Christ. Amen.
<br><br><br>
Glory, praise and honor to Thee, 
O King Christ, the Redeemer: 
to Whom children poured their glad and
sweet hosanna's song.
<br>
Glory, praise and honor to Thee, 
O King Christ, the Redeemer: 
to Whom children poured their glad and
sweet hosanna's song.
<br>
Thou art the King of Israel,
David's glorious descendant,
Thou Who comes in the name of the 
Lord, O blessed King.
<br>
Glory, praise and honor to Thee, 
O King Christ, the Redeemer: 
to Whom children poured their glad and
sweet hosanna's song.
<br>
All the heavenly host praises
Thee on high, 
likewise mortal man,
and the entire creation.
<br>
Glory, praise and honor to Thee, 
O King Christ, the Redeemer: 
to Whom children poured their glad and
sweet hosanna's song.
<br>
The Hebrew People came forth
with palms to greet Thee:
With prayers, vows, and hymns,
Behold, we now come to Thee.
<br>
Glory, praise and honor to Thee, 
O King Christ, the Redeemer: 
to Whom children poured their glad and
sweet hosanna's song.
<br>
They crowned Thee with praise
on Thy way to Thy suffering;
Behold, we compose songs to Thee,
now in Thy reigning. 
<br>
Glory, praise and honor to Thee, 
O King Christ, the Redeemer: 
to Whom children poured their glad and
sweet hosanna's song.
<br>
They were then pleasing to Thee, 
may our devotion now also please, 
O gracious King, O clement King,
to Whom all good things are pleasing.
<br>
Glory, praise and honor to Thee, 
O King Christ, the Redeemer: 
to Whom children poured their glad and
sweet hosanna's song.
<br>
As our Lord entered the holy city, the 
Hebrew children, declaring the 
resurrection of life with palm branches, 
cried out: “Hosanna in the highest.” 
When the people heard that Jesus was 
coming to Jerusalem, they went forth to
meet Him: With palm branches they 
cried out: “Hosanna in the highest.”
<br>
The Lord be with you.
And with your spirit.
Let us pray. 
O Lord Jesus Christ, our King and 
Redeemer,in Whose honor we have 
borne these palms and gone on 
praising Thee with song and solemnity: 
mercifully grant that whithersoever 
these palms are taken, there the grace 
of Thy blessing may descend, and may
every wickedness and trickery of the 
demons be frustrated, and may Thy 
right hand protect those it hath 
redeemed. Who lives and reigns 
forever and ever.
Amen.
