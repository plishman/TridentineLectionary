Hosanna to the son of David: blessed 
is he who comes in the name of the 
Lord.
O King of Israel, Hosanna in the 
highest.
The Lord be with you.
<br>
And with your spirit.
Let us pray. - Bless, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord, these branches of palm or 
olive: and grant that what Thy people 
today bodily perform for Thy honor, 
they may perfect spiritually with the 
utmost devotion, by gaining the victory 
over the enemy, and ardently loving 
every work of mercy. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth and 
reigneth with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Ghost, one God for ever and ever.
<br>
Amen.

The Hebrew children bearing olive 
branches, went forth to meet the Lord, 
crying out, and saying, Hosanna in the 
highest.
<br>
The earth is the Lord's and the fullness 
thereof: the world and all they that 
dwell therein.
For He hath founded it upon the seas: 
and hath prepared it upon the rivers.

garments in the way, and cried out, 
saying: “Hosanna to the Son of David: 
blessed is he who comes in the name 
of the Lord.”
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen.
