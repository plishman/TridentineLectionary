O God, my God, look upon me; why 
hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my 
salvation are the words of my sins. O 
my God, I shall cry by day, and Thou 
wilt not hear; and by night, and it shall 
not be reputed as folly in me. But Thou 
dwellest in the holy place, the praise of 
Isræl. In Thee have our fathers hoped: 
they have hoped, and Thou hast 
delivered them. They cried to Thee, 
and they were saved: they trusted in 
Thee, and were not confounded. But I 
am a worm, and no man: the reproach 
of men and the outcast of the people. 
All they that saw me have laughed me 
to scorn: they have spoken with the lips
and wagged the head. He hoped in the 
Lord, let Him deliver Him: let Him save 
Him, seeing He delighteth in Him. But 
they have looked and stared upon me: 
they parted my garments amongst 
them, and upon my vesture they cast 
lots. Deliver me from the lion’s mouth: 
and my lowness from the horns of the 
unicorns. Ye that fear the Lord, praise 
Him: all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify 
Him. There shall be declared to the 
Lord a generation to come; and the 
heavens shall show forth His justice. To
a people that shall be born, which the 
Lord hath made.
