At that time, when Jesus drew nigh to 
Jerusalem, and was come to 
Bethphage, unto Mount Olivet, then He 
sent two disciples, saying to them: Go 
ye into the village that is over against 
you, and immediately you shall find an 
ass tied, and a colt with her; loose them
and bring them to Me; and if any man 
shall say anything to you, say ye that 
the Lord hath need of them; and 
forthwith he will let them go. Now all 
this was done that it might be fulfilled 
which was spoken by the prophet, 
saying: Tell ye the daughter of Sion: 
Behold thy King cometh to thee meek, 
and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the 
foal of her that is used to the yoke. And 
the disciples going did as Jesus 
commanded them. And they brought 
the ass and the colt, and laid their 
garments upon them, and made Him sit
thereon. And a very great multitude 
spread their garments in the way, and 
others cut boughs from the trees, and 
strewed them in the way, and the 
multitudes that went before and that 
followed cried, saying: Hosanna to the 
Son of David; Blessed is He that 
cometh in the Name of the Lord.
