O Lord, keep not Thy help far from me: 
look to my defense: deliver me from the
lion's mouth and my lowness from the 
horns of the unicorns. (Ps. 21: 2) O 
God, my God, look upon me: why hast 
Thou forsaken me? Why cannot my 
sinful words reach Thee, Who art my 
salvation? O Lord, keep not Thy help 
far from me: look to my defense: deliver
me from the lion's mouth and my 
lowness from the horns of the unicorns.
