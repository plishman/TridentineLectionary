Brethren: yours is to be the same mind 
which Christ Jesus showed. His nature 
is, from the first, divine, and yet He did 
not see, in the rank of Godhead, a prize
to be coveted; He dispossessed 
Himself, and took the nature of a slave,
fashioned in the likeness of men, and 
presenting Himself to us in human 
form; and then He lowered His own 
dignity, accepted an obedience which 
brought Him to death, death on a cross.
That is why God has raised Him to 
such a height, given Him that name 
which is greater than any other name; 
<i>(Here all kneel.)</i> So that everything in 
heaven and on earth and under the 
earth must bend the knee before the 
name of Jesus, and every tongue must 
confess Jesus Christ as the Lord, 
dwelling in the glory of God the Father.
