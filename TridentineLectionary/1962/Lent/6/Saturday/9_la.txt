The Mass begins with the Kyrie eleison (No 
Prayers at the Foot, no Introit). Bells are 
rung and the organ is sounded during the 
Gloria. There is a threefold Alleluja after the
Epistle. The lights are off during the 
Gospel. The Credo is not said. There is no
Offertory verse. The Preface for Easter 
says in hac potissimum nocte, that is, “on 
this night above all”, rather than in hac 
postissima die, that is “on this day above 
all.” There is no kiss of peace. The Agnus 
Dei and the prayer of the priest Domine 
Jesu Christe qui dixisti (which follows the 
Agnus Dei) are omitted. After the 
Communion of the congregation, a 
shortened form of Lauds is sung. At the 
dismissal, Ite Missa est, alllelua, allelua is 
said, followed by Deo gratias, alleluja, 
alleluja. The Mass ends with the Blessing, 
there is no Last Gospel.
