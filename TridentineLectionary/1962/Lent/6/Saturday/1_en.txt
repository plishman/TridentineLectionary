Christ yesterday and today, the Beginning 
and the End, the Alpha and the Omega. 
His are the times and the ages. To Him be 
glory and empire
through all eternal ages. Amen.
<br>
Through His holy and glorious wounds
may Christ the Lord preserve and keep us. 
Amen.
<br>
May the light of Christ, gloriously risen
Dispel the darkness of the heart and mind.
<br>
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
Let us pray.
May the abundant outpouring of Thy <i>â€ </i> 
blessing, we beseech Thee, almighty God, 
descend upon this incense: and do Thou, O
invisible Regenerator, lighten this nocturnal 
brightness, that not only the sacrifice that is 
offered this night may shine by the secret 
mixture of Thy light: but also into whatever 
place anything of this mysterious 
sanctification shall be brought, there the 
power of Thy Majesty may be present and 
all the malicious artifices of Satan may be 
defeated. Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
