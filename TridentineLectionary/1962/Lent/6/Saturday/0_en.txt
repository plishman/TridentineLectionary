V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
<br>
Let us pray.
O God, Who hast bestowed on the faithful 
the fire of Thy brightness by Thy Son, Who 
is the Cornerstone, hallow this new fire 
produced from a flint that it may be 
profitable to us: and grant that during this 
Paschal festival we may be so inflamed with
heavenly desires, that with pure minds we 
may come to the solemnity of perpetual 
light. Through the same Christ our Lord.
<br>
R. Amen.
