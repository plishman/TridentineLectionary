(The celebrant again puts incense into the 
thurible. The procession is made in the 
following order: thurifer, subdeacon with 
cross, deacon with lit Paschal candle, 
celebrant, clerics according to their rank 
and precedence, then the people. When 
the deacon comes to the threshold of the 
Church, he stands and sings alone:)
<br>
Lumen Christi.
<br>
(At which all genuflect towards the Candle 
and reply:)
<br>
Deo gratias.
<br>
(The procession proceeds to the middle of 
the church, where the deacon sings in the 
same mode on
a higher pitch:)
<br>
Lumen Christi.
<br>
(At which all again genuflect towards the 
Candle and reply:)
<br>
Deo gratias.
<br>
The procession continues to the front of the
altar, in the middle of the sanctuary, and 
again the verse is sung on a higher pitch:)
<br>
Lumen Christi.
<br>
(At which all again genuflect towards the 
Candle and reply:)
<br>
Deo gratias.
<br>
(The people's candles are then lit from the 
Paschal candle.)
