On this most sacred night, dearly beloved 
brethren, Holy Mother Church, recalling the 
death and burial of Our Lord Jesus Christ, 
returneth His love by keeping vigil; and 
aboundeth with joy at celebrating His 
glorious Resurrection.
<br>
But because, as the Apostle teaches, we 
are baptised into His death and buried 
together with Christ: and as Christ rose 
again from the dead, so we too must walk in
newness of life; knowing that our old man 
hath been crucified together with Christ so 
that we shall no longer be in servitude to 
sin. Let us therefore look upon ourselves 
therefore as dead indeed to sin but living to 
God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<br>
Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, the 
Lenten observance now completed, let us 
renew the promises of baptism by which 
formerly we renounced Satan and his 
works, and the world likewise, the enemy of
God; and by which we promised to serve 
God faithfully in the Holy Catholic Church. 
Therefore:
<br>
<b>Priest:</b> Do you renounce Satan?
<b>All:</b> We do renounce him.
<b>P:</b> And all his works?
<b>A:</b> We do renounce them.
<b>P:</b> And all his pomps?
<b>A:</b> We do renounce them.
<b>P:</b> Do you believe in God the Father 
Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?
<b>A:</b> We do believe.
<b>P:</b> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only 
Son, our Lord, who was born into this world 
and who suffered for us?
<b>A:</b> We do believe.
<b>P:</b> Do you also believe in the Holy Spirit, the
holy Catholic Church, the Communionion of
Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the 
resurrection of the body, and life 
everlasting?
<b>A:</b> We do believe.
<b>P:</b> And now let us pray together as one, 
just as our Lord Jesus Christ taught us to 
pray:
<b>A:</b> Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed 
be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will 
be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us 
this day our daily bread, and forgive us our 
trespasses, as we forgive those who 
trespass against us. And lead us not into 
temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
<br>
<b>P:</b> And may God almighty, the Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, who hath regenerated us
by water and the Holy Spirit, and who hath 
given us remission of sins, may He by His 
grace keep us in the same Christ Jesus our 
Lord to life everlasting.
<b>A:</b> Amen.
