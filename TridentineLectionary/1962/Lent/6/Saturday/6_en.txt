V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
Let us pray
Almighty and everlasting God, be present at
these Mysteries of Thy great kindness, be 
present at these Sacraments: and send 
forth Thy Spirit of adoption to regenerate 
the new people, whom the font of baptism 
brings forth; that what is to be done by our 
humble ministry may be accomplished by 
the effect of Thy power. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
R. Amen.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
V. Lift up thy hearts.
R. We have them lifted up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God..
R. It is meet and just.
It is meet and just, right and availing unto 
salvation, to give Thee thanks always and 
in all places, O holy Lord, almighty Father, 
everlasting God, Who, by Thine ineffable 
power dost wonderfully produce the effect 
of Thy Sacraments: and though we are 
unworthy to perform such great mysteries: 
yet, as Thou dost not abandon the gifts of 
Thy grace, so Thou inclinest the ears of Thy
goodness, even to our prayers. O God, 
Whose Spirit in the very beginning of the 
world moved over the waters, that even 
then the nature of water might receive the 
virtue of sanctification. O God, Who by 
water didst wash away the crimes of the 
guilty world, and by the pouring out of the 
deluge didst give a figure of regeneration, 
that one and the same element might in a 
mystery be the end of vice and the 
beginning of virtue. Look, O Lord, on the 
face of Thy Church, and multiply in her Thy 
regenerations, who by the streams of Thine 
abundant grace fillest Thy city with joy, and 
openest the font of Baptism all over the 
world for the renewal of the Gentiles: that 
by the command of Thy Majesty she may 
receive the grace of Thine only Son from 
the Holy Spirit.
<br>
May He by a secret mixture of His divine 
virtue render this water fruitful for the 
regeneration of men, to the end that a 
heavenly offspring, conceived by 
sanctification, may emerge from the 
immaculate womb of this divine font, reborn
a new creature: and may all, however 
distinguished either by sex in body, or by 
age in time, be brought forth to the same 
infancy by grace, their mother. Therefore 
may all unclean spirits, by Thy command, O
Lord, depart far from hence: may the whole 
malice of diabolical deceit be entirely 
banished: may no power of the enemy 
prevail here: let him not fly about to lay his 
snares; may he not creep in by stealth: may
he not corrupt with his poison.
<br>
May this holy and innocent creature be free 
from all the assaults of the enemy, and 
purified by the destruction of all his 
wickedness. May it be a living fountain, a 
regenerating water, a purifying stream: that 
all those that are to be washed in this 
saving bath may obtain, by the operation of 
the Holy Spirit, the grace of a perfect 
cleansing.
<br>
Therefore, I bless thee, O creature of water,
by the living <b>†</b> God, by the true <b>†</b> God, by 
the holy <b>†</b> God: by that God Who, in the 
beginning, separated thee by His Word 
from the dry land, Whose Spirit moved over 
thee.
<br>
Who made thee flow from the fountain of 
paradise and commanded thee to water the
whole earth with thy four rivers. Who, 
changing thy bitterness in the desert into 
sweetness made thee fit to drink, and 
produced thee out of a rock to quench the 
thirsty people. I bless <b>†</b> thee also by our 
Lord Jesus Christ, His only Son: Who in 
Cana of Galilee changed thee into wine by 
a wonderful miracle of His power. Who 
walked upon thee with dry foot, and was 
baptized in thee by John in the Jordan. Who
made thee flow out of His side together with
His Blood, and commanded His disciples 
that such as believed should be baptized in 
thee, saying: Go, teach all nations, 
baptizing them in the Name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
<br>
Do thou, almighty God, mercifully assist us 
who observe this commandment: do Thou 
graciously inspire us.
Do Thou with Thy mouth bless these clear 
waters: that besides their natural virtue of 
cleansing the body, they may also prove 
efficacious for the purifying of the soul.
<br>
May the power of the Holy Spirit descend 
into all the water of this font.
<br>
May the power of the Holy Spirit descend 
into all the water of this font.
<br>
May the power of the Holy Spirit descend 
into all the water of this font.
<br>
And make the whole substance of this 
water fruitful for regeneration.
<br>
Here may the stains of all sins be washed 
out; here may human nature, created in 
Thine image, and reformed to the honor of 
its Author, be cleansed from all the filth of 
the old man: that all who receive the 
Sacrament of regeneration, may be born 
again new children of true innocence. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son: 
Who shall come to judge the living and the 
dead, and the world by fire. 
R. Amen.
<br>
May this font be sanctified and made fruitful
by the Oil of salvation, for those who are 
born anew therein unto life everlasting.
R. Amen.
<br>
May the infusion of the Chrism of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit the 
Comforter, be made in the Name of the 
Holy Trinity.
R. Amen.
<br>
May this mixture of the Chrism of 
sanctification, and of the Oil of unction, and 
of the water of Baptism, be made in equal 
degree in the Name of the <b>†</b> Father, <b>†</b> and 
of the Son, and of the Holy <b>†</b> Spirit.
R. Amen.
<br>
<b>Psalm 41: 2-4<b/>
As the hart panteth after the fountains of 
water, so my soul panteth after Thee, O 
God.
V. My soul hath thirsted for the living God: 
when shall I come and appear before the 
face of God?
V. My tears have become my bread day 
and night, while they say to me daily: 
Where is thy God?
<br>
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with thy spirit.
Let us pray.
O Almighty and everlasting God, look 
mercifully on the devotion of Thy people 
about to be reborn, who like the hart pant 
after the fountain of Thy waters: and 
mercifully grant that the thirst of their faith 
may, by the Sacrament of Baptism, hallow 
their souls and bodies. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
<br>
R. Amen.
