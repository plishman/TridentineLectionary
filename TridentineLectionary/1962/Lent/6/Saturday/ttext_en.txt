THE VIGIL:
<br>
The liturgy is begun so that the Mass which 
follows the Vigil begins about midnight. 
During the ceremonies until the Procession 
with the Pascal candle, violet vestments are
worn. White vestments are then worn for 
the Procession and the ceremonies which 
follow, including the Mass itself.
