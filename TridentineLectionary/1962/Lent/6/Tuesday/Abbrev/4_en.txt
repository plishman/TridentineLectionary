After they had crucified Jesus, from the
sixth hour there was darkness over the 
whole earth, until the ninth hour. And 
about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a 
loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma 
sabacthani? that is, My God, my God, 
why hast thou forsaken me? And some
that stood there and heard, said: This 
man calleth Elias. And immediately 
one of them running took a sponge, 
and filled it with vinegar; and put it on a 
reed, and gave him to drink. And the 
others said: Let be, let us see whether 
Elias will come to deliver him. And 
Jesus again crying with a loud voice, 
yielded up the ghost. (Here all kneel.) 
And behold the veil of the temple was 
rent in two from the top even to the 
bottom, and the earth quaked, and the 
rocks were rent. And the graves were 
opened: and many bodies of the saints 
that had slept arose.
