But it behooves us to glory in the cross 
of our Lord Jesus Christ: in Whom is 
our salvation, life, and Resurrection: by
Whom we are saved and delivered. 
(Ps. 66: 2) May God have mercy on 
us, and bless us: may he cause the 
light of his countenance to shine upon 
us, and may he have mercy on us. But
it behooves us to glory in the cross of 
our Lord Jesus Christ: in Whom is our 
salvation, life, and Resurrection: by 
Whom we are saved and delivered.
