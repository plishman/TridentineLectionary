But Thou, O Lord, have shown me, and
I have known: then Thou showed me 
their doings. And I was as a meek 
lamb, that is carried to be a victim: and 
I knew not that they had devised 
counsels against me, saying: Let us put
wood on his bread, and cut him off from
the land of the living, and let his name 
be remembered no more. But Thou, O 
Lord of Sabaoth, who judges justly, and
tries the reins and hearts, let me see 
Thy revenge on them: for to Thee I 
have revealed my cause, O Lord my 
God.
