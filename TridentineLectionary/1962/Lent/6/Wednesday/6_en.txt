Hear, O Lord, my prayer: and let my cry
come to thee. Turn not away thy face 
from me: in the day when I am in 
trouble, incline thy ear to me. In what 
day soever I shall call upon thee, hear 
me speedily. For my days are vanished
like smoke, and my bones are grown 
dry like fuel for the fire. I am smitten as 
grass, and my heart is withered: 
because I forgot to eat my bread. Thou 
shalt arise and have mercy on Sion: for
it is time to have mercy on it, for the 
time is come.
