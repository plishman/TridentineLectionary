Bow your heads to God.
Look down we beseech thee, O Lord, 
on this thy family for whose sake our 
Lord Jesus Christ refused not to yield 
himself into the hands of the wicked 
and to suffer the torments of the cross. 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
