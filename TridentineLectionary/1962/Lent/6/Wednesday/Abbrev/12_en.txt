Grant to our mind, almighty God, that 
by the temporal death of Thy Son, 
represented in these adorable 
mysteries, we may trust that Thou hast 
given to us eternal life. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
