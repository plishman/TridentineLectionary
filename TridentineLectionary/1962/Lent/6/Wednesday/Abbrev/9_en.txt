Receive, O Lord, we beseech Thee, 
the gift which we offer, mercifully 
granting that we may obtain that which 
we celebrate in this mystery of the 
passion of Thy Son our Lord, Through 
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
