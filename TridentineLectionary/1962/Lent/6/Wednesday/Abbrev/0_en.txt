At the name of Jesus every knee 
should bow, of those that are in 
Heaven, on earth, and under the earth: 
He humbled Himself, becoming 
obedient unto death, even to the death 
of the cross. And that every tongue 
should confess that the Lord Jesus 
Christ is in the glory of God the Father. 
(Ps. 101: 2) Lord, hear my prayer and 
let my cry come unto Thee. At the 
name of Jesus every knee should bow, 
of those that are in Heaven, on earth, 
and under the earth: He humbled 
Himself, becoming obedient unto 
death, even to the death of the cross. 
And that every tongue should confess 
that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory
of God the Father.
Let us pray. Let us kneel.
Arise.
