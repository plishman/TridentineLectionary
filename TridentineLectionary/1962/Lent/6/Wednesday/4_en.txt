O God, Who willed that Thy Son should
undergo for us the ignominy of the 
cross to deliver us from the power of 
the enemy : grant to us Thy servants, 
that we may obtain the grace of His 
resurrection. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
