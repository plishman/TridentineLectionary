Thus sayeth the Lord God : Telleth the 
daughter of Sion: Behold thy Savior 
cometh; behold His reward is with Him 
and His work before Him. Who is this 
that cometh from Edom, with dyed 
garments from Bosra, this beautiful one
in his robe, walking in the greatness of 
his strength? I, that speak justice, and 
am a defender to save. Why then is thy
apparel red, and thy garments like 
theirs that tread in the winepress? I 
have trodden the winepress alone, and 
of the Gentiles there is not a man with 
me: I have trampled on them in my 
indignation, and have trodden them 
down in my wrath, and their blood is 
sprinkled upon my garments, and I 
have stained all my apparel. For the 
day of vengeance is in my heart, the 
year of my redemption is come. I 
looked about, and there was none to 
help: I sought, and there was none to 
give aid: and my own arm hath saved 
for me, and my indignation itself hath 
helped me. And I have trodden down 
the people in my wrath, and have made
them drunk in my indignation, and have
brought down their strength to the 
earth. I will remember the tender 
mercies of the Lord, the praise of the 
Lord for all the things that the Lord hath
bestowed upon us.
