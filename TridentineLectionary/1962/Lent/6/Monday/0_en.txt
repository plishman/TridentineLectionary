Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong 
me: overthrow them that fight against 
me. Take hold of arms and shield: and 
rise up to help me. O Lord, my 
salvation. (Ps. 34: 3) Bring out the 
sword, and shut up the way against 
them that persecute me: say to my 
soul: I am thy salvation. Judge thou, O 
Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow 
them that fight against me. Take hold of
arms and shield: and rise up to help 
me. O Lord, my salvation.
