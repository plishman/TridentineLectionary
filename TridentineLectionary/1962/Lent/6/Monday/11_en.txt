Bow your heads to God.
Help us, O God, our Savior, and grant 
that we may draw nigh with joy, to keep
the memory of those mercies, whereby 
thou didst deign to restore us to life. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
