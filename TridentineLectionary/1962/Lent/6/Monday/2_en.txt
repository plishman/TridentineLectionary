The Lord God hath opened my ear, and
I do not resist: I have not gone back. I 
have given my body to the strikers, and
my cheeks to them that plucked them: I
have not turned away my face from 
them that rebuked me, and spit upon 
me. The Lord God is my helper, 
therefore am I not confounded: 
therefore have I set my face as a most 
hard rock, and I know that I shall not be
confounded. He is near that justifies 
me, who will contend with me? let us 
stand together, who is my adversary? 
let him come near to me. Behold the 
Lord God is my helper: who is he that 
shall condemn me? Lo, they shall all be
destroyed as a garment, the moth shall 
eat them up. Who is there among you 
that fears the Lord, that hears the voice
of his servant, that hath walked in 
darkness, and hath no light? let him 
hope in the name of the Lord, and lean 
upon his God.
