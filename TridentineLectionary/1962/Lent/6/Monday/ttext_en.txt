In the Mass, Christ calls upon His Father, protesting His own innocence and
imploring Him to curb the attacks of Satan upon the human race.
The Gospel, recounting the anointing of the feet of Jesus with the spikenard 
of great price, and the remarks of Judas Iscariot, are reminders of the coming 
betrayal, Passion, and death. The sweet perfume is the symbol of the perfection
of the contemplative life, which the worldlings look upon as wasted, but which 
fills the Church of Christ with sweetness.
