<i>(The ceremony begins with an 
exposition of the Cross. All Passiontide
it has been veiled. The 
deacon,accompanied by two acolytes 
with lighted candles, fetches it from 
the sacristy. As he enters the choir, the
celebrant and subdeacon go to meet 
him, and the celebrant receives the 
Cross in the middle before the altar. 
He unveils the Cross in three stages: 
first the upper portion, then the arms 
and, lastly, the whole Cross. As he 
unveils it, first on the Epistle side 
before the altar, then on the altar steps 
and finally at the centre of the altar, 
holding it up in the sight of the 
congregation, he sings on a higher 
note each time the following.)</i>
<br>
<b>V.</b> Ecce lignum Crucis, in quo salus 
mundi pependit.
<b>R.</b> Venite, adoremus.
<b>V.</b> Ecce lignum Crucis, in quo salus 
mundi pependit.

mundi pependit.
<b>R.</b> Venite, adoremus.

<i>(All then kneel and venerate the Cross 
in silence for a few moments.
Two acolytes hold up the Cross before 
the altar. The celebrant takes off his 
shoes and coming down to
the entrance to the choir returns 
towards the altar, genuflecting three 
times as he does so, and kisses the
feet of the crucifix. After the celebrant, 
the ministers, the clergy and the choir 
do likewise.)</i>
