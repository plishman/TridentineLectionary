Let us pray, dearly beloved, for the holy
Church of God: that our Lord and God 
may deign to give it peace, keep it in 
unity, and guard it throughout the world,
subjecting to it principalities and 
powers: and may grant unto us that, 
leading a peaceful and quiet life, we 
may glorify God, the Father almighty.
<b>P.</b> Let us pray.
<b>D.</b> Let us kneel.
<b>S.</b> Arise.
Almighty and everlasting God, Who in 
Christ hast revealed Thy glory too all 
nations: guard the works of Thy mercy; 
that Thy Church, spread over the whole
world, may with steadfast faith 
persevere in the confession of Thy 
Name. Through the same Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, our Lord, who liveth and 
reigneth with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, world without end.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
