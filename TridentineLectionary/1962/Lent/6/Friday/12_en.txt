Let us also pray for the Jews: that our 
God and Lord may illuminate their 
hearts, that they acknowledge that 
Jesus Christ is the Savior of all men.
<b>P.</b> Let us pray.
<b>D.</b> Let us kneel.
<b>S.</b> Arise.
Almighty, eternal God, Who wishes that
all men be saved and come to a 
knowledge of truth, propitiously grant 
that as the fullness of the nations 
enters Thy Church, all of Israel may be 
saved. Through the same Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, our Lord, who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, world without end.
<br>
<b>R.</b> Amen.
