on your lips.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ 
according to John.
<b>C.</b> At that time Jesus went forth with 
His disciples over the brook Cedron, 
where there was a garden, into which 
He entered with His disciples. And 
Judas also, who betrayed Him, knew 
the place: because Jesus had often 
resorted thither together with His 
disciples. Judas therefore having 
received a band of soldiers and 
servants from the chief priests and the 
Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns 
and torches and weapons. Jesus 
therefore, knowing that all things that 
should come upon Him, went forth and 
said to them: <b>J.</b> Whom seek ye? <b>C.</b> 
They answered Him: <b>S.</b> Jesus of 
Nazareth. <b>C.</b> Jesus saith to them: <b>J.</b> I 
am He. <b>C.</b> And Judas also, who 
betrayed Him, stood with them. As 
soon therefore as He had said to them: 
<b>J.</b> I am He; they went backward and fell
to the ground. Again therefore He 
asked them: <b>J.</b> Whom seek ye? <b>C.</b> And
they said: <b>S.</b> Jesus of Nazareth. <b>C.</b> 
Jesus answered: <b>J.</b> I have told you that
I am He. If therefore you seek Me, let 
these go their way; <b>C.</b> That the word 
might be fulfilled which He said: Of 
them whom Thou hast given Me, I have
not lost anyone. Then Simon Peter, 
having a sword, drew it and struck the 
servant of the high priest and cut off his
right ear. And the name of the servant 
was Malchus. Jesus therefore said to 
Peter: <b>J.</b> Put up thy sword in the 
scabbard. The chalice which My Father
hath given Me, shall I not drink it? <b>C.</b> 
Then the band and the tribune and the 
servants of the Jews took Jesus, and 
bound Him. And they led Him away to 
Annas first, for he was father-in-law to 
Caiphas, who was the high priest that 
year. Now Caiphas was he who had 
given the counsel to the Jews: that it 
was expedient that one man should die
for the people. And Simon Peter 
followed Jesus: and so did another 
disciple. And that disciple was known to
the high priest and went in with Jesus 
into the court of the high priest. But 
Peter stood at the door without. The 
other disciple therefore, who was 
known to the high priest, went out and 
spoke to the portress and brought in 
Peter. The maid therefore that was 
portress saith to Peter: <b>S.</b> Art not thou 
also one of this man's disciples? <b>C.</b> He 
saith: <b>S.</b> I am not. <b>C.</b> Now the servants 
and ministers stood at a fire of coals, 
because it was cold, and warmed 
themselves. And with them was Peter, 
also, standing and warming himself. 
The high priest therefore asked Jesus 
of His disciples and of His doctrine. 
Jesus answered him: <b>J.</b> I have spoken 
openly to the world. I have always 
taught in the synagogue and in the 
temple, whither all the Jews resort: and
in secret I have spoken nothing. Why 
asketh thou Me? Ask them who have 
heard what I have spoken unto them. 
Behold they know what things I have 
said. <b>C.</b> And when He had said these 
things, one of the servants, standing 
by, gave Jesus a blow, saying: <b>S.</b> 
Answerest Thou the high priest so? <b>C.</b> 
Jesus answered him: <b>J.</b> If I have 
spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; 
but if well, why strikest thou Me? <b>C.</b> 
And Annas sent Him bound to Caiphas 
the high priest. And Simon Peter was 
standing and warming himself. They 
said therefore to him: <b>S.</b> Art not thou 
also one of His disciples? <b>C.</b> He denied
it and said: <b>S.</b> I am not. <b>C.</b> One of the 
servants of the high priest a kinsman to
him whose ear Peter cut off saith to 
him: <b>S.</b> Did I not see thee in the garden
with Him? <b>C.</b> Again therefore Peter 
denied; and immediately the cock crew.
Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to 
the governor's hall. And it was morning;
and they went not into the hall, that 
they might not be defiled, but that they 
might eat the Pasch. Pilate therefore 
went out to them, and said: <b>S.</b> What 
accusation bring you against this man? 
<b>C.</b> They answered and said to him: <b>S.</b> If
He were not a malefactor, we would not
have delivered Him up to thee. <b>C.</b> 
Pilate therefore said to them: <b>S.</b> Take 
Him you, and judge Him according to 
your law. <b>C.</b> The Jews therefore said to 
him: <b>S.</b> It is not lawful for us to put any 
man to death. <b>C.</b> That the word of 
Jesus might be fulfilled, which He said, 
signifying what death He should die. 
Pilate therefore went into the hall again 
and called Jesus and said to Him: <b>S.</b> 
Art Thou the King of the Jews? <b>C.</b> 
Jesus answered: <b>J.</b> Sayest thou this 
thing of thyself, or have other told it 
thee of Me? <b>C.</b> Pilate answered: <b>S.</b> Am 
I a Jew? Thine own nation and the 
chief priests have delivered Thee up to 
me. What hast Thou done? <b>C.</b> Jesus 
answered: <b>J.</b> My kingdom is not of this 
world. If My kingdom were of this world,
My servants would certainly strive that I
should not be delivered to the Jews: 
but now My kingdom is not from hence.
<b>C.</b> Pilate therefore said to Him: <b>S.</b> Art 
Thou a King then? <b>C.</b> Jesus answered: 
<b>J.</b> Thou sayest I am a king. For this 
was I born, and for this came I into the 
world; that I should give testimony of 
the truth. Every one that is of the truth 
heareth My voice. <b>C.</b> Pilate saith to 
Him: <b>S.</b> What is truth? <b>C.</b> And when he 
had said this, he went out again to the 
Jews and saith to them: <b>S.</b> I find no 
cause in Him. But you have a custom 
that I should release one unto you at 
the Pasch. Will you, therefore, that I 
release unto you the King of the Jews? 
<b>C.</b> Then cried they all again, saying: <b>S.</b> 
Not this man, but Barabbas. <b>C.</b> Now 
Barabbas was a robber. Then therefore
Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him. 
And the soldiers platting a crown of 
thorns, put it upon His head; and they 
put on Him a purple garment. And they 
came to Him and said: <b>S.</b> Hail, King of 
the Jews. <b>C.</b> And they gave Him blows.
Pilate therefore went forth again and 
saith to them: <b>S.</b> Behold, I bring Him 
forth unto you, that you may know that I
find no cause in Him. <b>C.</b> Jesus 
therefore came forth, bearing the crown
of thorns and the purple garment. And 
he saith to them: <b>S.</b> Behold the man. C.
When the chief priests, therefore, and 
the servants had seen Him, they cried 
out, saying: <b>S.</b> Crucify Him, crucify Him.
<b>C.</b> Pilate saith to them: <b>S.</b> Take Him 
you, and crucify Him; for I find no cause
in Him. <b>C.</b> The Jews answered him: <b>S.</b> 
We have a law, and according to the 
law He ought to die, because He made 
Himself the Son of God. <b>C.</b> When 
Pilate, therefore, had heard this saying,
he feared the more. And he entered 
into the hall again; and he said to 
Jesus: <b>S.</b> Whence art Thou? <b>C.</b> But 
Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate 
therefore saith to Him: <b>S.</b> Speakest 
Thou not to me? Knowest Thou not that
I have power to crucify Thee, and I 
have power to release Thee? <b>C.</b> Jesus 
answered: <b>J.</b> Thou shouldst not have 
any power against Me, unless it were 
given thee from above. Therefore, he 
that hath delivered Me to thee hath a 
greater sin. <b>C.</b> And from henceforth 
Pilate sought to release Him. But the 
Jews cried out, saying: <b>S.</b> If thou 
release this Man, thou art not Cæsar's 
friend. For whosæver maketh himself a 
king speaketh against Cæsar. <b>C.</b> Now 
when Pilate had heard these words, he 
brought Jesus forth and sat down in the
judgment seat, in the place that is 
called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew 
Gabbatha. And it was Parasceve of the 
Pasch, about the sixth hour; and he 
saith to the Jews: <b>S.</b> Behold your King. 
<b>C.</b> But they cried out: <b>S.</b> Away with 
Him. Away with Him: Crucify Him. <b>C.</b> 
Pilate saith to them: <b>S.</b> Shall I crucify 
your King? <b>C.</b> The chief priests 
answered: <b>S.</b> We have no king but 
Cæsar. <b>C.</b> Then, therefore, he 
delivered Him to them to be crucified. 
And they took Jesus and led Him forth. 
And bearing His cross, He went forth to
that place which is called Calvary but in
Hebrew Golgotha.; where they crucified
Him, and with Him two others, one on 
each side and Jesus in the midst. And 
Pilate wrote a title also: and he put it 
upon the cross. And the writing was: 
Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the 
Jews. This title therefore many of the 
Jews did read: because the place 
where Jesus was crucified was nigh to 
the city. And it was written in Hebrew, 
Greek, and in Latin. Then the chief 
priests of the Jews said to Pilate: <b>S.</b> 
Write not: The King of the Jews; but 
that He said: I am the King of the Jews.
<b>C.</b> Pilate answered: <b>S.</b> What I have 
written, I have written. <b>C.</b> The soldiers 
therefore, when they had crucified Him,
took His garments and they made four 
parts, to every soldier a part and also 
His coat. Now the coat was without 
seam, woven from the top throughout. 
They said then one to another: <b>S.</b> Let 
us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, 
whose it shall be: that the Scripture 
might be fulfilled which saith: They 
have parted My garemnts among them,
and upon My vesture they have cast 
lots. And the soldiers indeed did these 
things. Now there stood by the cross of 
Jesus His Mother, and His Mother's 
sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary 
Magdalen. When Jesus therefore had 
seen His Mother and the disciple 
standing whom He loved, He saith to 
His Mother: <b>J.</b> Woman, behold thy son. 
<b>C.</b> After that, He saith to the disciple: J.
Behold thy mother. <b>C.</b> And from that 
hour, the disciple took her to his own. 
Afterwards, Jesus, knowing that all 
things were now accomplished, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled, said: <b>J.</b> I 
thirst. <b>C.</b> Now there was a vessel set 
there, full of vinegar. And they, putting a
sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, 
put it to His mouth. Jesus therefore, 
when He had taken the vinegar, said: J.
It is consummated. <b>C.</b> And bowing His 
head, He gave up the Spirit.
Then the Jews because it was the 
Parasceve, that the bodies might not 
remain upon the cross on the Sabbath 
day for that was a great Sabbath day, 
besought Pilate that their legs might be 
broken and that they might be taken 
away. The soldiers therefore came, and
they broke the legs of the first, and of 
the other that was crucified with Him. 
But after they were come to Jesus, 
when they saw that He was already 
dead, they did not break His legs. But 
one of the soldiers with a spear opened
His side, and immediately there came 
out blood and water. And he that saw it 
hath given testimony: and his testimony
is true. And he knoweth that he saith 
true: that you also may believe. For 
these things were done that the 
Scripture might be fulfilled: you shall 
not break a bone of Him. And again 
another Scripture saith: They shall look 
on Him whom they pierced. And after 
these things, Joseph of Arimathea 
because he was a disciple of Jesus, 
but secretly for fear of the Jews 
besought Pilate that he might take 
away the Body of Jesus. And Pilate 
gave leave. He came therefore and 
took away the Body of Jesus. And 
Nicodemus also came he who at the 
first came to Jesus by night, bringing a 
mixture of myrrh and alæs, about a 
hundred pound weight. They took 
therefore the Body of Jesus and bound 
it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the 
manner of the Jews is to bury. Now 
there was in the place where He was 
crucified a garden: and in the garden a 
new sepulchre, wherein no man yet 
had been laid. There, therefore, 
because of the Parasceve of the Jews, 
they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre 
was nigh at hand.
