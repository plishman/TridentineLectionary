O God who, by the Passion of Thy 
Christ, our Lord, hast loosened the 
bonds of death, that heritage of the first
sin to which all men of later times did 
succeed: make us so conformed to Him
that, as we must needs have borne the 
likeness of earthly nature, so we may 
by sanctification bear the likeness of 
heavenly grace. Through the same 
Christ our Lord. <b>R.</b> Amen.
