<i>(The Cross is then carried by two 
acolytes, with two others at their side 
bearing lighted candles, down to the 
entrance to the choir where it is 
venerated by the congregation in 
procession making only one 
genuflection as they do so. During the 
time that the veneration lasts, the 
following Reproaches are sung:)</i>
<br>
<b>V.</b> O my people, what have I done to 
thee? or wherein have I afflicted thee?

thee, that I have not done? I planted 
thee, indeed, My most beautiful

thou gavest Me vinegar to drink: and 
with a lance thou hast pierced the side 
of thy Savior.

Ant. We adore Thy Cross, O Lord: and 
we praise and glorify Thy holy 
Resurrection: for behold by the wood of
the Cross joy has come into the whole 
world.
<br>
May God have mercy on us, and bless 
us: may He cause the light of His 
countenance to shine upon us, and 
have mercy on us.

Ant. We adore Thy Cross, O Lord: and

Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, 
One and only noble Tree! None in 
foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit 
thy peer may be; Sweetest wood and 
sweetest iron, Sweetest weight is hung 
on thee.
Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle!
With completed victory rife!
And above the Cross's trophy
Tell the triumph of the strife:
How the world's Redeemer conquered
By the offering of His life.
<br>
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, 
One and only noble Tree! None in 
foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit 
thy peer may be. God, his Maker, 
sorely grieving, That the first-made 
Adam fell, When he ate the fruit of 
sorrow, Whose reward was death and 
hell, Noted then this Wood the ruin,
Of the ancient wood to quell.
<br>
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, 
Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
For this work of our salvation
Needs must have its order so,
And the manifold deceiver's
Art by art would overthrow,
And from thence would bring the 
healing, Whence the insult of the f√¶.
<br>
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, 
One and only noble Tree! None in 
foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit 
thy peer may be. Wherefore when the 
appointed fullness Of the holy time was
come, He was sent who maketh all 
things From th' eternal Father's home, 
And proceeded, God Incarnate,
Offspring of the Virgin's womb.
<br>
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, 
Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
Weeps the Infant in the manger
That in Bethlehem's stable stands:
And His Limbs the Virgin Mother
Doth compose in swaddling bands,
Meetly thus in linen folding
Of her God the feet and hands.
<br>
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, 
One and only noble Tree! None in 
foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit 
thy peer may be. Thirty years among 
us dwelling, His appointed time fulfilled,
Born for this, He meets His Passion, 
For that this He freely willed:
On the Cross the Lamb is lifted,
Where His life-blood shall be spilled.
<br>
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, 
Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
He endured the nails, the spitting,
Vinegar, and spear, and reed;
From that holy Body broken
Blood and water forth proceed:
Earth, and stars, and sky, and ocean,
By that flood from stain are freed.
<br>
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, 
One and only noble Tree! None in 
foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit 
thy peer may be. b. Bend thy boughs, 
O Tree of glory! Thy relaxing sinews 
bend; For awhile the ancient rigor,
That thy birth bestowed, suspend:
And the King of heavenly beauty
On thy bosom gently tend!
<br>
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, 
Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
Thou alone wast counted worthy
This world's ransom to uphold;
For a shipwrecked race preparing
Harbor, like the Ark of old;
With the sacred Blood anointed
From the smitten Lamb that rolled.
<br>
Ant. Faithful Cross! above all other, 
One and only noble Tree! None in 
foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit 
thy peer may be.
To the Trinity be glory
Everlasting, as is meet:
Equal to the Father, equal
To the Son, and Paraclete:
Trinal Unity, Whose praises
All created things repeat. Amen.
<br>
Ant. Sweetest wood and sweetest iron, 
Sweetest weight is hung on thee.
