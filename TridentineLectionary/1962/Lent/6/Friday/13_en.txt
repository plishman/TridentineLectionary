Let us pray also for the pagans: that 
almighty God would remove iniquity 
from their hearts: that, putting aside 
their idols, they may be converted to 
the true and living God, and His only 
Son, Jesus Christ our God and Lord.
<b>P.</b> Let us pray.
<b>D.</b> Let us kneel.
<b>R.</b> Arise.
Almighty and everlasting God, who 
ever seekest not the death, but the life 
of sinners: mercifully hear our prayer, 
and deliver them from the worship of 
idols: and join them to Thy holy Church 
for the praise and glory of Thy Name. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, world 
without end.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
