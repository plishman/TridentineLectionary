Let us pray also for heretics and 
schismatics: that our Lord God would 
be pleased to rescue them from all their
errors; and recall them to our holy 
mother the Catholic and Apostolic 
Church.
<b>P.</b> Let us pray.
<b>D.</b> Let us kneel.
<b>S.</b> Arise.
Almighty and everlasting God, who 
savest all, and wouldst that no one 
should perish: look on the souls that 
are led astray by the deceit of the devil:
that having set aside all heretical evil, 
the hearts of those that err may repent, 
and return to the unity of Thy truth. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, world 
without end.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
