Let us pray also for all Bishops, Priests,
Deacons, Subdeacons, Acolytes, 
Exorcists, Readers, Porters,

<b>P.</b> Let us pray.
<b>D.</b> Let us kneel.
<b>R.</b> Arise.
Almighty and everlasting God, by 
Whose Spirit the whole body of the 
Church is sanctified and ruled, hear our
humble pleading for all the orders 
thereof; that by the gift of Thy grace in 
all their several degrees may faithfully 
serve Thee. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the same Holy 
Spirit, God, world without end.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
