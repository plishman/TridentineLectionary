Let us pray, dearly beloved, to God the 
Father almighty, that He would cleanse 
the world of all errors: take away 
diseases, drive away famine, open 
prisons, break chains, grant a sure 
return to travelers, health to the sick, 
and a safe haven to those at sea.
<br>
<b>P.</b> Let us pray.
<b>D.</b> Let us kneel.
<b>R.</b> Arise.
Almighty and everlasting God, the 
comfort of the sorrowful, and the 
strength of those that labor: hasten the 
prayers of those that call upon Thee in 
any trouble reach Thee; that all may 
rejoice that in their necessities Thy 
mercy has helped them. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, world without end.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
