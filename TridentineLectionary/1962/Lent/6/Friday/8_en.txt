Let us pray also for all engaged in 
affairs of state and for all their 
ministries and powers: that our God 
and Lord may guide according to His 
will their minds and hearts, to our 
lasting peace.
<b>P.</b> Let us pray.
<b>D.</b> Let us kneel.
<b>R.</b> Arise.
Almighty and everlasting God, in 
Whose hands dwell all might and the 
rights of every people: look favorably 
on those who wield power over us; and 
let Thy right hand protect us, that, all 
the world through, both religious 
integrity and our country's security may
be firmly based and abide. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, world without end.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
