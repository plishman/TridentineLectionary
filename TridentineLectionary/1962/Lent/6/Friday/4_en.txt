<i>(After the Passion has been sung, the 
celebrant puts on the black cope, the 
deacon and the subdeacon
the dalmatic and tunicle of the same 
colour. Meanwhile two acolytes spread 
a linen cloth upon the
altar and put the book in the middle. 
The celebrant, with his ministers, goes 
up to the altar and
kisses it. Then, standing at the centre 
of the altar, he sings or recites the 
following solemn Collects.)</i>
