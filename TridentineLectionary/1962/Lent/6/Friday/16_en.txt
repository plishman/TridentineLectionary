<i>(The Cross is taken back and placed in
the centre of the altar between two 
lighted candles. The celebrant and 
ministers put on violet vestments. The 
deacon goes to the altar of Repose 
and brings back the blessed 
Sacrament, preceded by two acolytes 
bearing lighted candles. As they return 
the following antiphons are sung:)</i>
<br>
We adore Thee, O Christ, and we bless
Thee, because by Thy Cross Thou hast
redeemed the world.
Through a tree we were enslaved, and 
through a holy Cross have we been set
free: the fruit of a tree led us astray, the
Son of God bought us back.
<br>
Savior of the world, do Thou save us, 
do Thou, who through Thy Cross and 
Blood didst redeem us, do Thou help 
us, our God, we beseech Thee.
<br>
Let us pray.
Instructed by Thy saving precepts, and 
following Thy divine institution, we 
make bold to say:
<br>
Pater noster, qui es in cælis, 
sanctificetur nomen tuum. Adveniat 
regnum tuum. Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in
cælo, et in terra. Panem nostrum 
quotidianum da nobis hodie: et dimitte 
nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos 
dimittibus debitoribus nostris. Et ne nos
inducas in tentationem; sed libera nos 
a malo. Amen.
<br>
Deliver us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
from all evils, past, present, and to 
come; and by the intercession of the 
blessed and glorious ever Virgin Mary, 
Mother of God, and of the Holy 
Apostles, Peter and Paul, and of 
Andrew, and of all the Saints, mercifully
grant peace in our days, that through 
the assistance of Thy mercy we may be
always free from sin, and secure from 
all disturbance. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost
lives and reigns God, world without 
end.
<br>
Amen.
<br>
Let not the partaking of Thy Body, O 
Lord Jesus Christ, which I, though 
unworthy, presume to receive, turn to 
my judgment and condemnation; but let
it, through Thy mercy, become a 
safeguard and remedy, both for soul 
and body; Who with God the Father, in 
the unity of the Holy Ghost, livest and 
reignest God, forever and ever. Amen.
<br>
Lord, I am not worthy that Thou 
shouldst enter under my roof; say but 
the word, and my soul shall be healed.

Lord, I am not worthy that Thou

<br>
May the body of our Lord Jesus Christ 
preserve my soul unto life everlasting. 
Amen.
<br>
I confess to almighty God, to blessed 
Mary ever Virgin, to blessed Michael 
the Archangel, to blessed John the 
Baptist, to the holy Apostles Peter and 
Paul, to all the Saints, and to you 
father: that I have sinned exceedingly 
in thought, word, and deed: through my
fault, through my fault, through my 
most grievous fault. Therefore I pray 
blessed Mary ever Virgin, blessed 
Michael the Archangel, blessed John 
the Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and
Paul, all the Saints, and you, Father, to 
pray for me to the Lord our God.
<br>
May almighty God have mercy on you, 
forgive you your sins, and bring you to 
life everlasting.
Amen.
<i>✝</i>May the almighty and merciful Lord 
grant you pardon, absolution, and 
remission of your sins.
<br>
Amen.
<br>
Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him 
who takes away the sins of the world.
<br>
Lord, I am not worthy that Thou should 
enter under my roof; but only say the 
word and my soul shall be healed.

<i>(After the Communion of the 
congregation, at the centre of the altar, 
the celebrant sings the following
prayers while all the congregation 
stand and conclude each prayer with 
Amen:)</i>
Let us pray.
Upon Thy people who with devout 
hearts have recalled the Passion and 
Death of Thy Son, we beseech Thee, O
Lord, may plentiful blessings descend: 
may gentleness be used with us, and 
consolation given us, may our faith 
increase in holiness, our redemption for
ever made firm. Through the same 
Christ our Lord. 
<b>R.</b> Amen.
<br>
Let us pray.
Almighty and merciful God, who hast 
restored us by the Passion and Death 
of Thy Christ: preserve within us the 
work of Thy mercy; that by our entering
into this mystery we may ever live 
devoutly. Through the same Christ our 
Lord.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
<br>
Let us pray.
Be mindful of Thy mercies, O Lord, and
hallow us with eternal protection us Thy
servants, from whom Christ Thy Son 
established through His Blood this 
mystery of the Pasch. Through the 
same Christ our Lord.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
