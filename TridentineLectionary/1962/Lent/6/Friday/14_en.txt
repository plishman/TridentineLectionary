<i>(The ceremony begins with an 
exposition of the Cross. All Passiontide
it has been veiled. The 
deacon,accompanied by two acolytes 
with lighted candles, fetches it from 
the sacristy. As he enters the choir, the
celebrant and subdeacon go to meet 
him, and the celebrant receives the 
Cross in the middle before the altar. 
He unveils the Cross in three stages: 
first the upper portion, then the arms 
and, lastly, the whole Cross. As he 
unveils it, first on the Epistle side 
before the altar, then on the altar steps 
and finally at the centre of the altar, 
holding it up in the sight of the 
congregation, he sings on a higher 
note each time the following.)</i>

<b>V.</b> Behold the wood of the Cross, on 
which hung the Savior of the world.
<b>R.</b> Come, let us adore.
