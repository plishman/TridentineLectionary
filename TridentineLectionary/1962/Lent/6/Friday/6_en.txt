Let us pray for our most holy Father 
Pope <i>N.</i>, that our Lord and God, Who 
chose him to the order of the 
Episcopate, may keep him in health 
and safety for His holy Church to 
govern the holy people of God.
<b>P.</b> Let us pray.
<b>D.</b> Let us kneel.
<b>R.</b> Arise.
Almighty and everlasting God, by 
Whose judgment all things are 
established, mercifully regard our 
prayers, and in Thy goodness preserve
the Bishop chosen for us: that the 
Christian people who are ruled by 
Thine authority, may under so great a 
Pontiff, be increased in the merits of 
faith. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, world without end.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
