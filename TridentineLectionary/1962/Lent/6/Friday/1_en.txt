Thus saith the Lord: In their affliction 
they will rise early to Me: Come, and let
us return to the Lord, for He hath taken 
us, and He will heal us, He will strike, 
and He will cure us. He will revive us 
after two days: on the third day He will 
raise us up and we shall live in His 
sight. We shall know and we shall 
follow on, that we may know the Lord. 
His going forth is prepared as the 
morning light and He will come to us as
the early and the latter rain to the earth.
What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? 
What shall I do to thee, O Juda? Your 
mercy is as a morning cloud and as the
dew that g√¶th away in the morning. 
For this reason have I hewed them by 
the Prophets, I have slain them by the 
words of my mouth: and thy judgments 
shall go forth as the light. For I desired 
mercy and not sacrifice: and the 
knowledge of God more than 
holocausts.
<br>
O Lord, I have heard Thy hearing and 
was afraid: I have considered Thy 
works and trembled. In the midst of 
two animals Thou shalt be made 
known: when the years shall draw nigh 
Thou shalt be known: when the time 
shall come, Thou shalt be manifested. 
When my soul shall be in trouble, Thou 
wilt remember mercy, even in Thy 
wrath. God will come from Libanus, 
and the Holy One from the shady and 
thickly covered mountain. His majesty 
covered the heavens: and the earth is 
full of His praise.
<br>
Let us pray.
