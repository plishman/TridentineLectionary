Let us pray also for our Catechumens: 
that our Lord and God would open the 
ears of their hearts, and the gate of 
mercy; that, having received by the font
of regeneration the remission of all their
sins, they also may be found in Christ 
Jesus our Lord.
<br>
<b>P.</b> Let us pray.
<b>D.</b> Let us kneel.
<b>R.</b> Arise.
Almighty and everlasting God, who 
dost ever make Thy Church fruitful with
new offspring: increase the faith and 
understanding of our Catechumens; 
that being born again in the font of 
Baptism, they may be associated with 
the children of Thine adoption. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, world without 
end.
<b>R.</b> Amen.
