At that time, Jesus went about in 
Galilee, for He did not wish to go about
in Judea because the Jews were 
seeking to put Him to death. Now the 
Jewish feast of Tabernacles
was at hand. His brethren therefore
said to Him, Leave here and go into 
Judea that Thy disciples also may see 
the works that Thou do; for no one 
does a thing in secret if he wants to be 
publicly known. If Thou do these things,
manifest Thyself to the world. For not 
even His brethren believed in Him. 
Jesus therefore said to them, My time 
has not yet come, but your time is
always at hand. The world cannot hate 
you, but it hates Me because I bear 
witness concerning it, that its works 
are evil. As for you, go up to the feast, 
but I do not go up to this feast, for My 
time is not yet fulfilled. When He had 
said these things He stayed on in 
Galilee. But as soon as His brethren
had gone up to the feast, then He also 
went up, not publicly, but as it were 
privately. The Jews therefore were 
looking for Him at the feast, and were 
saying, Where is He? And there was 
much whispered comment among the 
crowd concerning Him. For some were 
saying, He is a good man. But others 
were saying, No, rather He seduces
the crowd. Yet for fear of the Jews no 
one spoke openly of Him.
