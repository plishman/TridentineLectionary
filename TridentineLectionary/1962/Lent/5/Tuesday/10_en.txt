Bow your heads to God.
Grant us, we beseech Thee, O Lord 
persevering service in Thy will: so that, 
in our days, the people serving Thee 
may increase both in number and in 
merit. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
