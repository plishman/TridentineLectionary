The story of Daniel in the lion's den read in this Mass was widely known in 
the early days of Christianity, for it is reproduced in many of the catacombs.
In the Postcommunion we beseech God that our frequency in drawing near 
to the holy table may be for us both a token and a pledge of our approaching 
each day nearer to the celestial altar and the eternal prize.
