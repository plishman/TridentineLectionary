In those days, the Babylonians went to 
the king and demanded: Hand over to 
us Daniel, who has destroyed Bel and 
killed the dragon, or we will kill you and
your family. When he saw himself 
threatened with violence, the king was 
forced to hand Daniel over to them. 
They threw Daniel into a lions’ den, 
where he remained six days. In the den
were seven lions, and two carcasses 
and two sheep had been given to them 
daily. But now they were given nothing, 
so that they would devour Daniel. In 
Judea there was a prophet, Habacuc; 
he mixed some bread in a bowl with the
stew he had boiled, and was going to 
bring it to the reapers in the field, when 
an Angel of the Lord told him, Take the 
lunch you have to Daniel in the lions’ 
den at Babylon. But Habacuc 
answered, Babylon, sir, I have never 
seen, and I do not know the den! The 
Angel of the Lord seized him by the 
crown of his head and carried him by 
the hair; with the speed of the wind, he 
set him down in Babylon above the 
den. Daniel, servant of God, cried 
Habacuc, take the lunch God has sent 
you. Thou hast remembered me, O 
God, said Daniel; Thou hast not 
forsaken those who love Thee. While 
Daniel began to eat, the Angel of the
Lord at once brought Habacuc back to 
his own place. On the seventh day the 
king came to mourn for Daniel. As he 
came to the den and looked in, there 
was Daniel, sitting in the midst of the 
lions! The king cried aloud, Thou art 
great, O Lord, the God of Daniel! 
Daniel he took out of the lions’ den, but 
those who had tried to destroy him he 
threw into the den, and they were 
devoured in a moment before his eyes.
Then the king said: Let all the
inhabitants of the whole earth fear the 
God of Daniel; for He is the Savior, 
working signs and wonders in the 
earth, Who has delivered Daniel out of 
the lions’ den.
