In those days, Jeremia said: O Lord, all
who forsake You shall be in disgrace; 
the rebels in the land shall be put to 
shame; they have forsaken the source 
of living waters, the Lord. Heal me, 
Lord, that I may be healed; save me, 
that I may be saved, for it is You whom 
I praise. See how they say to me, 
‘Where is the word of the Lord? Let it 
come to pass!’ Yet I am not troubled, 
following You as my shepherd; the day
without remedy I have not desired. You
know what passed my lips; it is present 
before You. Do not be my ruin, You, my
refuge in the day of misfortune. Let my
persecutors, not me, be confounded; 
let them, not me, be broken. Bring upon
them the day of misfortune, crush them
with repeated destruction, O Lord, our 
God.
