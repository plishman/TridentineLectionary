Caiphas the high priest spoke, saying that Jesus should die for the nation. 
Christ is to die in order to bring together all the children of God dispersed 
throughout the world in one great family, which shall be neither Jew nor Greek 
nor Gentile, but only one holy Catholic Church.
God holds the souls of all men in his hands, and we should welcome with 
open arms those whom he has brought back from a long way off, remembering 
how we, too, had once strayed far away, but are now converted to the Shepherd
of our souls.
