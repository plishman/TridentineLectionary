At that time, the chief priests and 
Pharisees gathered together a council 
against Jesus, and said, What are we 
doing? for this man is working many 
signs. If we let Him alone as He is, all 
will believe in Him, and the Romans will
come and take away both our
place and our nation. But one of them,
Caiphas, being high priest that year, 
said to them, You know nothing at all; 
nor do you reflect that it is expedient for
us that one man die for the people, 
instead of the whole nation perishing. 
This, however, he said not of himself; 
but being high priest that year, he 
prophesied that Jesus was to die for 
the nation; and not only for the nation, 
but that He might gather into one the
children of God who were scattered
abroad. So from that day forth their 
plan was to put Him to death. Jesus 
therefore no longer went about openly 
among the Jews, but withdrew to the 
district near the desert, to a town 
called Ephrem; and there He stayed 
with His disciples.
