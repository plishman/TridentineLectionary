Graciously pour forth Thy grace into 
our hearts, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
that, keeping our sinful inclinations 
under control by self-denial, we may 
suffer for a brief while rather than be 
condemned to everlasting punishment.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
