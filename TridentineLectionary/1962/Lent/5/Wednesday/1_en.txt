Enlighten the hearts of Thy faithful by 
this sanctified fast, O God of mercy, 
and of Thy kindness turn a pitying ear 
to the suppliants to whom Thou givest 
the spirit of devotion. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
