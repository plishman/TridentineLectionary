At that time, it was the feast of the 
Dedication at Jerusalem, and it was 
winter. And Jesus walked in the temple,
in Solomon's porch. The Jews 
therefore came round about Him, and 
said to Him: How long dost Thou hold 
our souls in suspense? If Thou be the 
Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus answered 
them: I speak to you, and you believe 
not. The works that I do in the name of 
My Father they give testimony of Me; 
but you do not believe, because you 
are not of My sheep. My sheep hear 
My voice, and I know them, and they 
follow Me. And I give them life ever-
lasting, and they shall not perish 
forever, and no man shall pluck them 
out of My hand. That which My Father 
hath given Me is greater than all, and 
no one can snatch them out of the 
hand of My Father. I and the Father are
one. The Jews then took up stones to 
stone Him. Jesus answered them, 
Many good works I have showed you 
from My Father; for which of those 
works do you stone Me? The Jews 
answered Him: For a good work we 
stone Thee not, but for blasphemy: and
because that Thou, being a man, 
makest Thyself God. Jesus answered 
them, Is it not written in your law, I 
said, You are gods? If he called them 
gods, to whom the word of God was 
spoken, and the Scripture cannot be 
broken; do you say of Him, Whom the 
Father hath sanctified and sent into the 
world, Thou blasphemest: because I 
said, I am the Son of God? If I do not 
the works of My Father, believe Me not:
but if I do, though you will not believe 
Me, believe the works, that you may 
know and believe that the Father is in 
Me, and I in the Father.
