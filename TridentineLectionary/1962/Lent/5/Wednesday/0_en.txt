My deliverer from the angry nations: 
Thou wilt lift me up above them that 
rise up against me: from the unjust man
Thou wilt deliver me, O Lord, (Ps. 17: 
2-3) I will love Thee, O Lord, my 
strength: the Lord is my firmament, and
my refuge, and my deliverer. My 
deliverer from the angry nations: Thou 
wilt lift me up above them that rise up 
against me: from the unjust man Thou 
wilt deliver me, O Lord.
