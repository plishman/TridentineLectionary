Bow down your heads before God.
Give ear unto our supplications, O 
almighty God, and benignly grant the 
effect of Thy accustomed mercy to 
those whom Thou hast allowed to be 
confident in the hope of Thy good will. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
