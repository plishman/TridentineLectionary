The Lenten fast is now drawing to its close, wherefore we pray in the Collect
that the abstinence which we have practiced, being sanctified by the 
mortification of all our evil passions, may serve to enlighten the hearts of the 
faithful. God himself has placed this desire in our hearts, so we trust that he will 
graciously accept it and will grant it abundant fruit.
