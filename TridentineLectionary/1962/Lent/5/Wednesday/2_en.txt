In those days, the Lord spoke to 
Moses, saying, Speak to all the 
multitude of the children of Israel, and 
thou shalt say to them: I am the Lord 
your God, You shall not steal. You shall 
not lie; neither shall any man deceive 
his neighbor. Thou shalt not swear 
falsely by My name, nor profane the 
name of thy God: I am the Lord. Thou 
shalt not calumniate thy neighbor, nor 
oppress him by violence. The wages of 
him that has been hired by thee shall 
not abide with thee until the morning. 
Thou shalt not speak evil of the deaf, 
nor put a stumbling block before the 
blind; but thou shalt fear the Lord thy 
God, because I am the Lord. Thou 
shalt not do that which is unjust, nor 
judge unjustly. Respect not the person 
of the poor, nor honor the countenance 
of the mighty; but judge thy neighbor 
according to justice. Thou shalt not be 
a detractor, nor a whisperer among the 
people. Thou shalt not stand against 
the blood of thy neighbor. I am the 
Lord. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in 
thy heart, but reprove him openly, lest 
thou incur sin through him. Seek not 
revenge, nor be mindful of the injury of 
thy citizens. Thou shalt love thy friend 
as thyself. I am the Lord. Keep ye My 
laws: for I am the Lord your God.
I will extol Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast 
upheld me: and hast not made my 
enemies to rejoice over me. O Lord, my
God, I have cried to Thee, and Thou 
hast healed me: Thou hast brought 
forth, O Lord, my soul from hell; Thou 
hast saved me from them that go down 
into the pit.
