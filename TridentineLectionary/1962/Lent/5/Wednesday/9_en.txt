Having received the blessing of the 
heavenly gift, we, Thy suppliants, 
implore Thee, O God, that the same 
may be the cause both of the 
sacrament and of our salvation. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
