Judge me, O God, and distinguish my 
cause from the nation that is not holy: 
deliver me from the unjust and deceitful
man, for Thou art my God and my 
strength. (Ps. 42: 3) Send forth Thy 
light and Thy truth: they have 
conducted me, and brought me unto 
Thy holy hill, and into Thy tabernacles. 
Judge me, O God, and distinguish my 
cause from the nation that is not holy: 
deliver me from the unjust and deceitful
man, for Thou art my God and my 
strength.
