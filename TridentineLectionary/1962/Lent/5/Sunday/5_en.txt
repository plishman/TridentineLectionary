At that time, Jesus said to the 
multitudes of the Jews: Which of you 
shall convince Me of sin? If I say the 
truth to you, why do you not believe 
Me? He that is of God, heareth the 
words of God. Therefore you hear them
not, because you are not of God. The 
Jews therefore answered, and said to 
Him: Do not we say well, that Thou art 
a Samaritan, and hast a devil? Jesus 
answered: I have not a devil, but I 
honor My Father, and you have 
dishonored Me. But I seek not My own 
glory; there is One that seeketh and 
judgeth. Amen, amen, I say to you, If 
any man keep My word, he shall not 
see death for ever. The Jews therefore 
said: Now we know that Thou hast a 
devil. Abraham is dead, and the 
prophets; and Thou sayest: If any man 
keep My word, he shall not taste death 
for ever. Art Thou greater than our 
father Abraham, who is dead? and the 
prophets are dead. Whom dost Thou 
make Thyself? Jesus answered: If I 
glorify Myself, My glory is nothing. It is 
My Father that glorifieth Me, of Whom 
you say that He is your God. And you 
have not known Him; but I know Him. 
And if I shall say that I know Him not, I 
shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know
Him, and do keep his word. Abraham 
your father rejoiced that he might see 
My day: he saw it, and was glad. The 
Jews therefore said to Him: Thou art 
not yet fifty years old, and hast Thou 
seen Abraham? Jesus said to them: 
Amen, amen, I say to you, before 
Abraham was made, I AM. They took 
up stones therefore to cast at Him; but 
Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the 
temple.
