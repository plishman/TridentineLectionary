Brethren: Christ being come, a High 
Priest of the good things to come, by a 
greater and more perfect tabernacle, 
not made with hands, that is, not of this
creation, neither by the blood of goats 
or of calves, but by His own blood, 
entered once into the Holies, having 
obtained eternal redemption. For if the 
blood of goats and of oxen, and the 
ashes of a heifer being sprinkled, 
sanctify such as are defiled, to the 
cleansing of the flesh, how much more 
shall the blood of Christ, who through 
the Holy Spirit, offered Himself without 
spot to God, cleanse our conscience 
from dead works, to serve the living 
God? And therefore He is the Mediator 
of the new Testament; that by means of
His death, for the redemption of those 
transgressions which were under the 
former Testament, they that are called 
may receive the promise of eternal 
inheritance, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
