The Mass of this Sunday is entirely dominated by the memory of the 
Sacrifice on Golgotha, and is one of the most beautiful and pathetic in the whole
Roman Antiphonary. Beginning with today's Mass, the concluding doxology (the
Gloria Patri....) is omitted until Easter. Psalm 42 (Judica me) is sung at the 
Introit, and is therefore omitted during the prayers at the foot of the altar. It will 
not be heard again there until Easter.
The communion verse (1 Cor. 11: 24-25) expresses the union of the daily 
sacrifice with the Passion of our Lord. The liturgical celebration of the Passion 
begins today; the words of St. Paul (as adapted by the Church) emphasize the 
commemoration of the sufferings and death of Christ in every reception of Holy 
Communion. The whole Christian life (as St. Ambrose remarked) is linked 
through its sufferings, austerities, self-denials and sacrifices, with the singular 
sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The whole work of salvation is the continuation and 
completion of the mystery of our Savior's death and resurrection. His sacrifice 
sanctifies and consecrates all our sacrifices and makes of them one offering 
before God.
