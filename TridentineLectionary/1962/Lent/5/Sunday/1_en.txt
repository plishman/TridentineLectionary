Look down in mercy, we beseech Thee,
O Lord, upon Thy family; by Thy 
governance may we be outwardly 
protected in body; by Thy favor may we
be inwardly strengthened in heart and 
mind. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
