All that Thou hast done to us, O Lord,
Thou hast done in true judgment: 
because we have sinned against Thee,
and have not obeyed Thy 
commandments: but give glory to Thy 
name, and deal with us according to 
the multitude of Thy mercy. (Ps. 118: 1)
Blessed are the undefiled in the way: 
who walk in the law of the Lord. All that
Thou hast done to us, O Lord,
Thou hast done in true judgment: 
because we have sinned against Thee,
and have not obeyed Thy 
commandments: but give glory to Thy 
name, and deal with us according to 
the multitude of Thy mercy.
