Bow your heads to God.
Be merciful to Thy people, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord: that rejecting those 
things which displease Thee, we may 
rather be filled with the delights of Thy 
commandments. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
