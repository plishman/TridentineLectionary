In those days: Azarias prayed to the 
Lord saying: O Lord, our God, deliver 
us not up for ever, we beseech Thee, 
for Thy name's sake, and abolish not 
Thy covenant. And take not away Thy 
mercy from us, for the sake of 
Abraham, Thy beloved, and Isaac, Thy 
servant, and Israel, Thy holy one: To 
whom Thou hast spoken, promising 
that Thou wouldst multiply their seed as
the stars of heaven, and as the sand 
that is on the sea shore. For we, O 
Lord, are diminished more than any 
nation, and are brought low in all the 
earth this day for our sins. Neither is 
there at this time prince, or leader, or 
prophet, or holocaust, or sacrifice, or 
oblation, or incense, or place of first 
fruits before thee, that we may find Thy 
mercy: nevertheless, in a contrite heart 
and humble spirit let us be accepted. 
As in holocausts of rams, and bullocks, 
and as in thousands of fat lambs: so let
our sacrifice be made in Thy sight this 
day, that it may please Thee: for there 
is no confusion to them that trust in 
Thee. And now we follow Thee with all 
our heart, and we fear Thee, and seek 
Thy face. Put us not to confusion, but 
deal with us according to Thy 
meekness, and according to the 
multitude of Thy mercies. And deliver 
us, according to Thy wonderful works, 
and give glory to Thy name, O Lord: 
and let all them be confounded that 
shew evils to Thy servants, let them be 
confounded in all Thy might, and let 
their strength be broken: And let them 
know that Thou art the Lord, the only 
God, and glorious over all the world, O
Lord, our God.
