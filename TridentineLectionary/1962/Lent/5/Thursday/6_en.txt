O Lord our God, Who in these 
elements, which Thou has created for 
the support of our weakness, hast 
commanded gifts to be appointed and 
dedicated to Thy name: grant, we 
beseech Thee, that they may be made 
the support of our present life, and 
may become a sacrament for all 
eternity. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
