At that time one of the Pharisees 
desired Jesus to eat with him. And He 
went into the house of the Pharisee 
and sat down to meat. And behold a 
woman that was in the city, a sinner, 
when she knew that He sat at meat in 
the Pharisee's house, brought an 
alabaster box of ointment. And 
standing behind at His feet, she began 
to wash His feet with tears and wiped 
them with the hairs of her head and 
kissed His feet and anointed them with 
the ointment. And the Pharisee, who 
had invited Him, seeing it, spoke within
Himself, saying: This man, if He were a
prophet, would know surely who and 
what manner of woman this is that 
touches Him, that she is a sinner. And 
Jesus answering, said to him: Simon, I 
have somewhat to say to thee. But he 
said: Master, say it. A certain creditor 
had two debtors: the one owed five 
hundred pence and the other fifty. And 
whereas they had not 
wherewith to pay, he forgave them 
both. Which therefore of the two loves 
him most? Simon answering, said: I 
suppose that he to whom he forgave 
most. And He said to him: Thou hast 
judged rightly. And turning to the 
woman, He said unto Simon:Dost thou 
see this woman? I entered into thy 
house: thou gave Me no water for My 
feet. But she with tears hath washed 
My feet; and with her hairs hath wiped 
them. Thou gave Me no kiss. But she, 
since she came in, hath not ceased to 
kiss My feet. My head with oil thou 
didst not anoint. But she with ointment 
hath anointed My feet. Wherefore, I say
to thee: Many sins are forgiven her, 
because she hath loved much. But to 
whom less is forgiven, he loves less. 
And He said to her: Thy sins are 
forgiven thee. And they that sat at meat
with Him began to say within 
themselves: Who is this that forgives 
sins also? And He said to the woman: 
Thy faith hath made thee safe. Go in 
peace.
