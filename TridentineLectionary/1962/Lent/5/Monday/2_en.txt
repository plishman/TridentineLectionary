In those days, the word of the Lord 
came to Jona a second time: Set out 
for the great city of Ninive, and 
announce to it the message that I will 
tell you. So Jona made ready and went 
to Ninive, according to the Lord’s 
bidding. Now Ninive was an 
enormously large city; it took three 
days to go through it. Jona began his 
journey through the city, and had gone 
but a single day’s walk announcing, 
Forty days more and Ninive shall be 
destroyed, when the people of Ninive 
believed God; they proclaimed a fast 
and all of them, great and small, put on 
sackcloth. When the news reached the 
King of Ninive, he rose from his throne, 
laid aside his robe, covered himself 
with sackcloth, and sat in the ashes. 
Then he had this proclaimed
throughout Ninive, by decree of the 
king and his nobles: Neither man nor 
beast, neither cattle nor sheep, shall 
taste anything; they shall not eat, nor 
shall they drink water. Man and beast 
shall be covered with sackcloth and call
loudly to God; every man shall turn 
from his evil way and from violence he 
has in hand. Who knows, God may 
relent and forgive, and withhold His 
blazing wrath, so that we shall not 
perish. And God saw by their actions 
how they turned from their evil way; 
and the Lord, our God, had mercy upon
His people.
