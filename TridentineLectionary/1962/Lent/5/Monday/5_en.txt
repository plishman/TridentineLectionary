At that time, the rulers and Pharisees 
sent attendants to seize Jesus. Jesus 
then said, Yet a little while I am with 
you, and then I go to Him Who sent 
Me. You will seek Me and will not find 
Me; and where I am you cannot come. 
The Jews therefore said among 
themselves, Where is He going that
we shall not find Him? Will He go to 
those dispersed among the Gentiles, 
and teach the Gentiles? What is this 
statement that He has made, ‘You will 
seek Me and will not find Me, and 
where I am you cannot come’? Now on 
the last, the great day of the feast, 
Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If 
anyone thirst, let him come to Me and
drink. He who believes in Me, as the 
Scripture says, ‘From within him there 
shall flow rivers of living waters.’ He 
said this, however, of the Spirit Whom 
they who believed in Him were to 
receive.
