Bow your heads to God.
O Lord, we beseech Thee, grant unto 
Thy people health of soul and body, 
that, by persevering in good works, we 
may be always worthy of Thy powerful 
protection. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
