In the Collect we ask two things of God: firstly, that He would so sanctify our 
Lenten fast that our interior dispositions may harmonize with our bodily 
abstinence; and, secondly, that our penitence and contrition of heart may obtain 
for us the pardon of our past shortcomings.
In the Gospel, grace is compared to water, because, like water, it 
extinguishes the fire of the passions, refreshes the spirit, quenches the thirst of 
immoderate desires, and gives life and growth to the beauteous flowers of 
virtue.
