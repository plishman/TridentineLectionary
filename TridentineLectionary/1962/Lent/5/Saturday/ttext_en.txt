In the Collect we beseech God that the people who are dedicated to Him 
may increase in the affections of pious devotion and may develop by good 
works that seed of holiness which was sown in their hearts at holy Baptism. The 
school in which they must learn this lesson of perfection is the Church herself 
with her Sacraments and her Liturgy; so that the Christian life may become one 
long chain of graces connected one with another, each grace serving to prepare
and dispose us to receive another.
During our present lives every chastisement sent by God is for our 
correction; in the Prayer over the People, the Church asks for the special help 
of God that will enable the soul to make the acts of contrition and love which 
must precede its reconciliation and forgiveness; then comes the purification 
from sin by the infusion of sanctifying grace. In a few days Christ will be lifted 
up on the cross, whence He will draw all men unto Himself.
