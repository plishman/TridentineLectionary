Blessed art Thou, O Lord, teach me 
Thy justifications: and deliver me not 
up to the proud who calumniate me: 
and I will answer a word to those who 
upbraid me.
Be propitiated, we beg Thee, O Lord, 
and pardon all our offenses, whom 
Thou dost grant to be sharers in so 
great a mystery. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
