Bow down your heads to God.
Let Thy right hand, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord, guard the people that calleth 
upon Thee, and let it teach the people 
that they may be fittingly purified; that 
by the consolation of the present they 
may profit for the good things that are 
to come. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
