Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am 
afflicted: deliver me, and save me out 
of the hands of my enemies, and from 
them that persecute me: let me not be 
confounded, O Lord, for I have called 
upon Thee. (Ps. 30: 2) In Thee, O 
Lord, have I hoped, let me never be 
confounded: deliver me in Thy justice.
