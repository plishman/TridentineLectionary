In those days, the wicked Jews said 
one to another, Come, and let us invent
devices against the just; for the law 
shall not perish from the priest, nor 
counsel from the wise, nor the word 
from the prophet: come, and let us 
strike him with the tongue, and let us 
give no heed to all his words. Give 
heed to me, O Lord, and hear the 
voice of my adversaries. Shall evil be 
rendered for good; because they have 
dug a pit for my soul? Remember that I
have stood in Thy sight, to speak good 
for them, and to turn away Thy 
indignation from them. Therefore 
deliver up their children to famine, and 
bring them into the hands of the sword: 
let their wives be bereaved of children, 
and widows; and let their husbands be 
slain by death: let theIr young be 
stabbed with the sword in battle. Let a 
cry be heard out of their houses; for 
Thou shalt bring the robber upon them 
suddenly, because they have dug a pit 
to take me, and have hid snares for my 
feet. But Thou, O Lord, knowest all 
their counsel against me unto death: 
forgive not their iniquity, and let not 
their sin be blotted out from Thy sight; 
let them be overthrown before Thine 
eyes; in the time of Thy wrath do Thou 
destroy them, O Lord, our God.
