Let the people consecrated to Thee, O 
Lord, we beseech, grow unceasingly in 
the spirit of loving devotion, that, being 
taught by sacred observances, it may 
feel the increase of more precious gifts
as it increaseth in favor with Thy 
majesty. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
