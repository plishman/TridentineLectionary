In those days Ezechias was sick even 
to death, and Isaias the son of Amos 
the prophet came unto him, and said to
him: Thus saith the Lord: Take order 
with thy house, for thou shalt die, and 
not live. And Ezechias turned his face 
towards the wall and prayed to the 
Lord, and said: I beseech Thee, O 
Lord, remember how I have walked 
before Thee in truth, and with a perfect 
heart, and have done that which is 
good in Thy sight. And Ezechias wept 
with great weeping. And the word of the
Lord came to Isaias, saying: Go and 
say to Ezechias: Thus saith the Lord 
the God of David thy father: I have 
heard thy prayer, and I have seen thy 
tears: behold I will add to thy days 
fifteen years: and I will deliver thee and 
this city out of the hand of the king of 
the Assyrians, and I will protect it, saith 
the Lord almighty.
