At that time, when Jesus had entered 
Capharnaum, there came to Him a 
centurion, who entreated Him, saying, 
Lord, my servant is lying sick in the 
house, paralyzed, and is grievously 
afflicted. Jesus said to him, I will come 
and cure him. But in answer the 
centurion said, Lord, I am not worthy 
that You should come under my roof; 
but only say the word, and my servant 
will be healed. For I too am a man 
subject to authority, and have soldiers 
subject to me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ 
and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ 
and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do 
this,’ and he does it. And when Jesus 
heard this, He marveled, and said to 
those who were following Him, Amen I 
say to you, I have not found such great 
faith in Israel. And I tell you that many 
will come from the east and from the 
west, and will feast with Abraham and 
Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of 
heaven, but the children of the kingdom
will be put forth into the darkness 
outside; there will be the weeping, and 
the gnashing of teeth. Then Jesus said 
to the centurion, Go your way; as you 
have believed, so be it done to you. 
And the servant was healed in that 
hour.
