O God, Who by sin art offended and by
penance appeased, mercifully regard 
the prayers of Thy suppliant people: 
and turn aside the scourges of Thine 
anger, which we deserve for our sins. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(for St. Thomas Aquinas)
O God, Who dost enlighten Thy Church
with the wondrous learning of blessed 
Thomas, Thy Confessor, and dost 
make it fruitful with his holy labors, 
grant us, we beseech Thee, both to 
understand what he taught and to 
imitate what he practiced. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
