Having received the blessing of this 
heavenly gift, we humbly entreat Thee,
almighty God, that it may be to us an 
assurance both of sacramental grace 
and of salvation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(for St. Thomas Aquinas)
In order that Thy sacrifices may render 
salvation to us, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, that blessed Thomas, Thy 
Confessor and illustrious Doctor, may 
act as intercessor. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
