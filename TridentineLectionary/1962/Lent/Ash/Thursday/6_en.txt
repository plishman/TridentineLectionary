Look down favourably, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, on these Sacrifices, that 
they may profit us both unto our 
devotion and salvation. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(for St. Thomas Aquinas)
May the holy prayer of St. Thomas, Thy
Confessor and Doctor, fail us not, O 
Lord: may it render our offerings 
acceptable, and ever obtain for us Thy 
pardon. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
