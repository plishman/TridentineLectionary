Thus saith the Lord: Be converted to 
Me with all your heart, in fasting and in 
weeping and in mourning. And rend 
your hearts and not your garments, 
and turn to the Lord your God; for He is
gracious and merciful, patient and rich 
in mercy, and ready to repent of the 
evil. Who knoweth but He will return 
and forgive and leave a blessing 
behind Him, sacrifice and libation to the
Lord your God? Blow the trumpet in 
Sion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn 
assembly, gather together the people, 
sanctify the Church, assemble the 
ancients, gather together the little ones
and them that suck at the breasts let 
the bridegroom go forth from his bed 
and the bride out of her bride chamber.
Between the porch and the altar the 
priests, the Lord's ministers, shall weep
and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare 
Thy people and give not Thy 
inheritance to reproach, that the 
heathen should rule over them. Why 
should they say among the nations 
Where is their God? The Lord hath 
been zealous for His land, and hath 
spared His people. And the Lord 
answered and said to His people: 
Behold I will send you corn and wine 
and oil, and you shall be filled with 
them and I will no more make you a 
reproach among the nations; saith the 
Lord almighty.
