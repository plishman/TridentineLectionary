Thou hast mercy upon all, O Lord, and 
hatest none of the things which Thou 
hast made, overlooking the sins of men
for the sake of repentance, and sparing
them because Thou art the Lord our 
God. (Ps. 56: 2) Have mercy on me, O 
God, have mercy on me for my soul 
trusteth in Thee. Glory be to the Father
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now and 
ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
Thou hast mercy upon all, O Lord, and 
hatest none of the things which Thou 
hast made, overlooking the sins of men
for the sake of repentance, and sparing
them because Thou art the Lord our 
God.
