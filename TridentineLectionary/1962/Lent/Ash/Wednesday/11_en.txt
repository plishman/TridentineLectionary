Bow down your heads before God.
Look down graciously, O Lord, upon 
those who bow before Thy majesty; 
that they who are refreshed by Thy 
divine gift may ever be sustained by 
heavenly aid. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
