Grant, O Lord, to Thy faithful people 
that they may begin the venerable 
solemnities of fasting with becoming 
piety, and may persevere to the end 
with steadfast devotion. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
