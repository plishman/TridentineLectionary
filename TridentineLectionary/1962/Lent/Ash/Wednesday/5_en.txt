At that time, Jesus said to His 
disciples: When you fast, be not as the 
hypocrites, sad. For they disfigure their
faces, that they may appear unto men 
to fast. Amen I say to you, they have 
received their reward. But thou, when 
thou fastest, anoint they head and 
wash thy face, that thou appear not to 
men to fast, but to thy Father who is in 
secret: and thy Father who seeth in 
secret will repay thee. Lay not up to 
yourselves treasures on earth: where 
the rust and moth consume, and where
thieves break through and steal. But 
lay up to yourselves treasures in 
heaven where neither the rust nor moth
doth consume, and where thieves do 
not break through nor steal. For where 
thy treasure is, there is thy heart also.
