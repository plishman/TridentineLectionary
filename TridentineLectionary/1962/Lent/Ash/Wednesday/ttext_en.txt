Collecta at St. Anastasia. Station at St. Sabina. 
Since the time of St. Gregory the Great this day has inaugurated at Rome
the forty holy days of Lent, and was called in capite jejunii (the beginning of the 
fast). The canonical penance imposed on public penitents began on this day. In 
the rite of the blessing of the ashes, the last trace remains of the ceremony of 
the imposition of canonical penance on public penitents. Towards the Eleventh 
Century the disciplinary rule of public penance having been done away with, 
instead of the penitents of former days, the Pope, the clergy, and the Roman 
people took part indiscriminately in this function, and began to walk barefoot, 
with ashes sprinkled on their heads, to the Basilica at St. Sabina.
The collecta or assembly of the people was at the church of St. Anastasia, 
where the ashes were imposed on the heads of the clergy and people. They 
then proceded up the Aventine Hill to the little church founded or rebuilt under 
Celestine I (423-32) by an Illyrian priest by the name of Peter and called by the 
name Sabina even before the relics of the martyred St. Sabina were brought 
thither from the area Vindiciani (her cemetery).
The rubric prescribes that the ashes blessed on this day be obtained by the 
burning of the palms, or green branches, blessed on the Palm Sunday of the 
preceding year.
