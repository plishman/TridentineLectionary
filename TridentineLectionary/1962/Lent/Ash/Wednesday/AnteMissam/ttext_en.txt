The blessing of the ashes is one of the great liturgical rites of the year. It 
was originally instituted for public penitents, but is now intended for all 
Christians, as Lent should be a time of penance for all. The ashes used are 
obtained by burning the palms of the previous year.
After the blessing, the faithful approach the sanctuary and receive the ashes
in the form of a cross on their foreheads and with the words: "Remember man 
that thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return."
