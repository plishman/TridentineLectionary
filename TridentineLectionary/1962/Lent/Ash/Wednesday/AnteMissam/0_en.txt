Hear us O Lord, for Thy mercy is kind: 
look upon us, O Lord,according to the 
multitude of Thy tender mercies. Save 
me, O God, for the waters have come 
in even unto my soul. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Hear us O Lord, for Thy 
mercy is kind: look upon us, O 
Lord,according to the multitude of Thy 
tender mercies.

<b>Priest:</b> The Lord be with you.
<br>
<b>All:</b> And with your spirit.
<b>P:</b> Let us pray. Almighty eternal God, 
spare them that are penitent, be 
merciful to Thy suppliants, and 
vouchsafe to send Thy holy angel from 
heaven to bless <i>+</i> and sanctify <i>+</i> these 
ashes, that they may be a wholesome 
remedy to all who humbly call upon Thy
holy name, and who, accusing
themselves of their sins as their
consciences accuse them, deplore their
crimes before the face of Thy divine 
clemency or, eagerly and humbly 
entreat Thy excellence and goodness;
and grant, by the invocation of Thy 
most holy name, that any who shall be 
sprinkled with these ashes for the 
remission of their sins, may receive
health of body and salvation of soul. 
Through Christ our Lord.
<br>
<b>A:</b> Amen.
<br>
<b>P:</b> Let us pray. O God, who desirest 
not the death death of sinners, but
their repentance, most graciously 
regard the frailty of human nature; and, 
of Thy loving kindness, deign to bless
<i>+</i> these ashes, which we intend to put 
upon our heads to express our 
lowliness and win Thy pardon, that we, 
who know that we are but ashes and
for the guilt of our fall shall return to 
dust, may be worthy to obtain, through 
Thy mercy, the forgiveness of all our 
sins and the rewards promised to the 
penitent. Through Christ our Lord.
<br>
<b>A:</b> Amen.
<br>
<b>P:</b> Let us pray. O God, Who art moved 
by humiliation and appeased by 
penance, incline the ear of Thy 
goodness to our prayers, and when the
heads of Thy servants are touched with
these ashes, graciously pour forth the 
grace of Thy blessing, that Thou 
mayest fill them with the spirit of 
compunction and mayest effectually 
grant what they righteously ask, and 
ordain that what Thou grantest may 
remain forever established and 
unmoved. Through Christ our Lord.
<b>A:</b> Amen.
<br>
<b>P:</b> Let us pray. Almighty eternal God, 
Who didst bestow the healing of Thy 
pardon upon the Ninivites when they 
repented in ashes and sackcloth,
 mercifully grant that we may so imitate 
them in behavior as to be like them in 
obtaining pardon. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
<b>A:</b> Amen.
<br><br><br>
<b>P:</b> Thou shalt sprinkle me, O Lord, with 
hyssop, and I shall be cleansed. Thou 
shalt wash me and I shall become 
whiter than snow.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>P:</b> Remember, man, <i>+</i> that thou art 
dust, and unto dust thou shalt return.
<br><br><br>
Let us change our garments for ashes 
and sackcloth: let us fast and lament 
before the Lord: for our God is 
plenteous in mercy to forgive our 
sins.
<br>
Between the porch and the altar, the 
priests, the Lord's ministers, shall 
weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, 
spare Thy people; and shut
not the mouths of them that sing to 
thee, O Lord.
<br>
Let us amend and do better for those 
things in which we have sinned through
ignorance lest, suddenly prevented by 
the day of death, we seek time for 
penance, and be not able to find it. 
Attend, O Lord, and have mercy: for we
have sinned against Thee. 
(Ps. 78:9) Help us, O God, our Saviour:
and for the honor of Thy name, O Lord,
deliver us. 
Attend, O Lord, and have mercy: for we
have sinned against Thee. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen.
Attend, O Lord, and have mercy: for we
have sinned against Thee. 
<br><br><br>
<b>P:</b> Let us pray. Grant us, O Lord, to 
enter upon the duties of our Christian 
warfare with holy fasts, that, being 
about to fight against the spirits of 
wickedness, we may be fortified by the
help of self-denial. Through Christ our 
Lord.
<b>A:</b> Amen.
