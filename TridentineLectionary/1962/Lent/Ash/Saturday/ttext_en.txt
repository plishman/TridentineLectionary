The Lesson of the Mass teaches that in order to receive the divine graces, 
we must break the bond of sin, perform outward works of mercy, and render 
God inward and spiritual worship. The choice of the Gospel has reference to 
the numerous miracles obtained by the faithful at the tomb of St. Lawrence, 
whose church in Rome was the gathering point for the procession before today's
Mass.
