At that time, when it was late, the ship 
was in the midst of the sea, and Jesus 
alone on the land. And seeing His 
disciples straining at the oars, for the 
wind was against them, about the 
fourth watch of the night He came to 
them, walking upon the sea, and He 
would have passed by them. But they,
seeing Him walking upon the sea, 
thought it was a ghost, and cried out. 
For they all saw Him, and were 
troubled. Then He immediately spoke 
to them, and said to them, Take 
courage; it is I, do not be afraid. And
He got into the boat with them, and the 
wind fell. And they were utterly beside 
themselves with astonishment, for they 
had not understood about the loaves, 
because their heart was blinded. And 
crossing over, they came to the land of 
Genesareth and moored the boat. And 
when they had gotten out of the boat, 
the people at once recognized Him; 
and they hurried through the whole 
country, and began to bring the sick on 
their pallets, wherever they heard He 
was. And wherever He went, into 
village or hamlet or town, they laid the 
sick in the market places, and 
entreated Him to let them touch but the 
tassel of His cloak; and as many as 
touched Him were saved.
