Bow down your heads before God.
May Thy faithful people, O God, be 
strengthened by Thy gifts; that by 
receiving them, they may still desire 
them, and by desiring them, may 
evermore receive them. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
