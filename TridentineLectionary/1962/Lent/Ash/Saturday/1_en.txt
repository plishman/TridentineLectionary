May Thy kindly favor, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, accompany the fast we 
have begun, that we may be able to 
practice with a pure mind what we 
perform bodily. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(for St. Frances of Rome)
O God, Who, among other gifts of Thy 
grace didst honor blessed Frances, 
Thine handmaid, with the familiar 
companionship of an angel, grant, we 
beseech Thee, that by the help of her 
intercession we may deserve to attain 
the company of angels. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
