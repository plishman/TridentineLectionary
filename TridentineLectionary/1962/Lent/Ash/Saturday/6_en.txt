Receive, O Lord, this sacrifice by which
You have graciously willed to be 
appeased: grant, we beseech You, 
that, cleansed by its effects, we may 
offer You the love of our hearts as an 
acceptable gift. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(for St. Frances of Rome)
May the offerings of thy holy people be 
accepted by Thee, O Lord, in honor of 
Thy saints, through whose merits they 
know that they have received aid in 
time of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
