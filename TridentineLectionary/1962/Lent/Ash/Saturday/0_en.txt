The Lord has heard, and has had pity 
on me; the Lord became my helper. 
(Ps. 29: 2) I will extol You, O Lord, for 
You drew me clear and did not let my 
enemies rejoice over me. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. The Lord has heard, and 
has had pity on me; the Lord became 
my helper.
