Fortified by the Bread of Life, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, that what is a 
sacrament in this life may become a 
help to life eternal. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(for St. Frances of Rome)
Thou hast filled Thy household, O Lord,
with sacred gifts; ever comfort us, we 
beseech Thee, by the intercession of 
the saint whose festival we celebrate. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
