Thus saith the Lord God: If thou wilt 
take away the chain out of the midst of 
thee and cease to stretch out the finger
and to speak that which profitteth not. 
When thou shalt pour out thy soul to 
the hungry and shall satisfy the afflicted
soul, then shall thy light rise up in 
darkness and thy darkness shall be as 
the noonday. And the Lord will give 
thee rest continually and fill thy soul 
with brightness and deliver thy bones; 
and thou shalt be like a watered 
garden, and like a fountain of water 
whose waters shall not fail. And the 
places that have been desolate for 
ages shall be built in thee; thou shalt 
raise up the foundations of generation 
and generation; and thou shalt be 
called the repairer of of the fences, 
turning the paths into rest. If thou turn 
away thy foot from the sabbath, from 
doing thy own will in my holy day, and 
call the sabbath delightful and the holy 
of the Lord glorious, and glorify him, 
while thou dost not thy own ways and 
thy own will is not found to speak a 
word: then shall thou be delighted in 
the Lord, and I will lift thee above the 
high places of the earth and will feed 
thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy 
father, For the mouth of the Lord hath 
spoken it.
