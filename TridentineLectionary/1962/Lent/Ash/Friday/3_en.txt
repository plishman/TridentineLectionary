Thus says the Lord God: Cry out full-
throated and unsparingly, lift up your 
voice like a trumpet blast; tell My 
people their wickedness, and the house
of Jacob their sins. They seek Me day 
after day, and desire to know My ways, 
like a nation that has done what is just 
and not abandoned the law of their 
God; they ask Me to declare what is 
due them, pleased to gain access to 
God: Why do we fast, and Thou dost 
not see it? afflict ourselves, and Thou 
takest no note of it? Lo, on your fast 
day you carry out your own pursuits, 
and drive all your laborers. Yes, your 
fast ends in quarreling and fighting, 
striking with wicked fist. Would that 
today you might fast so as to make 
your voice heard on high! Is this the 
manner of fasting I wish, of keeping a 
day of penance: that a man bow his 
head like a reed, and lie in sackcloth 
and ashes? Do you call this a fast, a 
day acceptable to the Lord? This, 
rather, is the fasting that I wish: 
releasing those bound unjustly, untying 
the thongs of the yoke; setting free the 
oppressed, breaking every yoke; 
sharing your bread with the hungry, 
sheltering the oppressed and the 
homeless; clothing the naked when you
see them, and not turning your back on
your own. Then your light shall break 
forth like the dawn, and your wound 
shall quickly be healed; your vindication
shall go before you, and the glory of the
Lord shall be your rear guard. Then you
shall call, and the Lord will answer, you 
shall cry for help, and He will say: Here 
I am! For I, the Lord your God, am 
merciful.
