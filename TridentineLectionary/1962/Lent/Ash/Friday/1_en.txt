The Lord has heard, and has had pity 
on me; the Lord became my helper. 
(Ps. 29: 2) I will extol You, O Lord, for 
You drew me clear and did not let my 
enemies rejoice over me. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. The Lord has heard, and 
has had pity on me; the Lord became 
my helper.
May Thy kindly favour, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, accompany the fast we 
have begun, that we may be able to 
practice with a pure mind what we 
perform bodily. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
