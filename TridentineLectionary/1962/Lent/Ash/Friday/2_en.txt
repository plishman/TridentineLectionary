(for St. John of God)
O God, Who didst cause blessed John,
when burning with love of Thee, to walk
unharmed through the midst of flames, 
and by his means didst enrich Thy 
Church with a new Religious Order, 
grant, through the aid of his merits, that
our evil passions may be consumed by 
the fire of Thy love, and that we may 
receive healing remedies unto life 
everlasting. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
