At that time, Jesus said to His 
disciples, You have heard that it was 
said: You shall love your neighbour, 
and shall hate your enemy. But I say to 
you: love your enemies, do good to 
those who hate you, and pray for those 
who persecute and calumniate you, so 
that you may be children of your Father
in heaven, Who makes His sun to rise 
on the good and the evil, and sends 
rain on the just and the unjust. For if 
you love those that love you, what 
reward shall you have? Do not even 
the publicans do that? And if you salute
your brethren only, what are you doing 
more than others? Do not even the 
Gentiles do that? You therefore are to 
be perfect, even as you heavenly 
Father is perfect. Take heed not to do 
your good before men, in order to be 
seen by them; otherwise you shall have
no reward with your Father in heaven. 
Therefore when you give alms, do not 
sound a trumpet before you, as the 
hypocrites do in the synagogues and 
streets, in order that they may be 
honoured by men. Amen: I say to you, 
they have received their reward. But 
when you give alms, do not let your left 
hand know what your right hand is 
doing, so that your alms may be given 
in secret; and your Father, Who sees in
secret, will reward you.
