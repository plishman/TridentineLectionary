Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice 
before Him with trembling; embrace 
discipline, lest you perish from the just 
way.
Fill us, O Lord, with the spirit of Thy
love, to unite in charity those whom 
Thou hast filled with one and the same 
heavenly Bread. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
