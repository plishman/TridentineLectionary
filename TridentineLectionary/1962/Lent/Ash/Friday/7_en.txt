O Lord, for the sake of Thy promise 
give me life, that I may know Thy 
decrees.
Grant, O Lord, we beseech Thee, that 
as we offer the sacrifice of Lent, our 
hearts may be made acceptable to 
Thee; and the sacrifice may give us 
greater willingness for self-denial. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
