Grant us, O Lord, ever to obey Your 
commandments, that we may be 
worthy of Thy sacred gifts. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
Appeased, O Lord by the intercession 
of Thy saints, grant, we beseech Thee, 
that we may obtain by the celebration 
of this temporal act our eternal 
salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
