Mercifully help us, O Lord, to fulfill this
holy observance, that by Thy grace we
may carry out those things which we 
have learned, on Thy word, must be 
done. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we, who acknowledge the 
boldness of thy glorious martyrs in 
confessing Thy name, may experience 
likewise their loving intercession for us. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
