Through this sacrament, O Lord, 
graciously perform Thy holy work, that 
it may cleanse us of earthly vices and 
bring us to heavenly rewards. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
Look down, O Lord, upon the prayers 
and oblations of Thy faithful; that they 
may be agreeable to Thee on the feast 
of Thy saints, and obtain for us the help
of Thy propitiation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
