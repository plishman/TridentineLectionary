At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowds
and to His disciples, saying, The 
Scribes and the Pharisees have sat on 
the chair of Moses. All things, 
therefore, that they command you, 
observe and do. But do not act 
according to their works; for they talk 
but do nothing. And they bind together 
heavy and oppressive burdens, and lay
them on menâ€™s shoulders; but not with 
one finger of their own do they choose 
to move them. In fact, all their works 
they do in order to be seen by men; for 
they widen their phylacteries,
and enlarge their tassels, and love the 
first places at suppers and the front 
seats in the synagogues, and greetings
in the market place, and to be called by
men: Rabbi. But do not you be called: 
Rabbi; for one is your
Master, and all you are brothers. And 
call no one on earth your father; for one
is your Father, Who is in heaven. 
Neither be called masters; for one only 
is your Master, the Christ. He who is 
greatest among you shall be your 
servant. And whoever exalts himself
shall be humbled, and whoever 
humbles himself shall be exalted.
