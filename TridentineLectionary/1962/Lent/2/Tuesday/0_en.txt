To Thee my heart speaks; Thou my 
glance seeks; Thy presence, O Lord, I 
seek. Hide not Thy face from me. (Ps. 
26: 1) The Lord is my light and my 
salvation; whom should I fear? Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. To Thee my 
heart speaks; Thou my glance seeks; 
Thy presence, O Lord, I seek. Hide not 
Thy face from me.
