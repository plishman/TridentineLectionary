Bow your heads to God.
Mercifully heed our humble prayers, O
Lord, and heal the weakness of our 
souls, that having obtained 
forgiveness, we may ever rejoice in Thy
blessing. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
