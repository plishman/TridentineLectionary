In those days, the word of the Lord 
came to Elias the Thesbite, saying: 
Arise, and go to Sarepta of the 
Sidonians, and dwell there: for I have 
commanded a widow woman there to 
feed you. He arose, and went to 
Sarepta. And when he was come to the
gate of the city, he saw the widow
woman gathering sticks, and he called 
her, and said to her: Give me a little 
water in a vessel, that I may drink. And 
when she was going to fetch it, he 
called after her, saying, Bring me also, I
beseech you, a morsel of bread in your 
hand. And she answered: As the Lord 
your God lives, I have no bread,
but only a handful of meal in a pot, and 
a little oil in a cruse. Behold I am 
gathering two sticks, that I may go in a 
dress it for me and my son, that we 
may eat it, and die. And Elias said to 
her: Fear not, but go and do as you 
have said; but first make for me of the 
same meal a little hearth-cake, and
bring it to me; and after make for 
yourself and your son. For thus says 
the Lord the God of Israel: The pot of 
meal shall not waste, nor the cruse of 
oil be diminished, until the day wherein 
the Lord will give rain upon the face of 
the earth. She went, and
did according to the word of Elias; and 
he ate, and she, and her house; and 
from that day the pot of meal wasted 
not, and the cruse of oil was not 
diminished, according to the word of 
the Lord, which He spoke in the hand 
of Elias.
