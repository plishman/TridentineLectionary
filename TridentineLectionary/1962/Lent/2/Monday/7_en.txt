O Lord, may this sacrifice of propitiation
and praise render us worthy of Thy 
protection. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(for St. Cyril)
Look down with favor, O Lord, upon the
immaculate victim which we offer to 
Thee, and grant that, by the merits of 
the blessed bishop and confessor, 
Cyril, we may earnestly endeavor to 
receive it with a pure heart. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
