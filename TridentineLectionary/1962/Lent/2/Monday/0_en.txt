Redeem me, O Lord, and have mercy 
on me. My foot hath stood in the direct 
way: in the churches I will bless Thee, 
O Lord. (Ps. 25: 1) Judge me, O Lord, 
for I have walked in my innocence: and 
I have put my trust in the Lord, and 
shall not be weakened. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Redeem me, O Lord, and 
have mercy on me. My foot hath stood 
in the direct way: in the churches I will 
bless Thee, O Lord.
