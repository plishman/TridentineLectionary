Bow your heads to God.
Be attentive to our supplications, O 
almighty God, and kindly grant the 
effect of Thy wonted mercy to those 
whom Thou dost permit confidently to 
rely on Thy goodness. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
