At that time Jesus said to the 
multitudes of the Jews: I go, and you 
shall seek me, and you shall die in your
sin. Whither I go, you cannot come. 
The Jews therefore said: Will he kill 
himself, because he said: Whither I go, 
you cannot come? And he said to them:
You are from beneath, I am from 
above. You are of this world, I am not of
this world. Therefore I said to you, that 
you shall die in your sins. For if you 
believe not that I am he, you shall die in
your sin. They said therefore to him: 
Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The 
beginning, who also speak unto you. 
Many things I have to speak and to 
judge of you. But he that sent me, is 
true: and the things I have heard of 
him, these same I speak in the world. 
And they understood not, that he called
God his Father. Jesus therefore said to 
them: When you shall have lifted up the
Son of man, then shall you know, that I 
am he, and that I do nothing of myself, 
but as the Father hath taught me, these
things I speak: And he that sent me, is 
with me, and he hath not left me alone: 
for I do always the things that please 
him.
