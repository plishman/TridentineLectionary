In those days Daniel prayed to the 
Lord, saying: O Lord our God, who hast
brought forth Thy people out of the land
of Egypt with a strong hand, and hast 
made thee a name as at this day: we 
have sinned, we have committed 
iniquity, O Lord, against all Thy justice: 
let Thy wrath and Thy indignation be 
turned away, I beseech thee, from Thy 
city Jerusalem, and from Thy holy 
mountain. For by reason of our sins, 
and the iniquities of our fathers, 
Jerusalem, and Thy people are a 
reproach to all that are round about us. 
Now therefore, O our God, hear the 
supplication of Thy servant, and his 
prayers: and shew Thy face upon Thy 
sanctuary which is desolate, for Thy 
own sake. Incline, O my God, Thy ear, 
and hear: open Thy eyes, and see our 
desolation, and the city upon which Thy
name is called: for it is not for our 
justifications that we present our 
prayers before Thy face, but for the 
multitude of Thy tender mercies. O 
Lord, hear: O Lord, be appeased: 
hearken and do: delay not for Thy own 
sake, O my God: because Thy name is 
invocated upon Thy city, and upon Thy 
people, O Lord, our God.
