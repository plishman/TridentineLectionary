May this communion, O Lord, purge us
from guilt, and make us partakers of 
Thy heavenly remedy. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(for St. Cyril)
May the sacrament of Thy body and 
blood; O Lord Jesus Christ, which we 
have received, by the prayers of the 
blessed Bishop Cyril, sanctify our 
minds and hearts, that we may deserve
to become partakers of the divine 
nature: Who lives and reigns with God 
the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
