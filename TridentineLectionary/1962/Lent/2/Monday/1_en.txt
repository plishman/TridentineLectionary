Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that Thy household, in mortifying 
the flesh by fasting from food, may 
follow after justice by abstaining from 
sin. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(for St. Cyril)
Grant us, we beseech Thee, O 
almighty God, through the intercession 
of the blessed Bishop Cyril, so to know 
Thee, the only true God, and Jesus 
Christ, Whom Thou hast sent, that we 
may deserve to be numbered forever 
among the sheep that hear His voice. 
Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, our Lord, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
