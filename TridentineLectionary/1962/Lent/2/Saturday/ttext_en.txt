As the liturgy of this day lays great stress on the contrast between the two 
brothers, Esau and Jacob, and between the faithful son and the prodigal, it is 
possible that underneath there lies an allusion to that executioner, Who expiated
his crime by baptism and penitence.
We ourselves were once a long way off, lIke the prodigal son, and if we now
belong to the household of the faith it is because the Good Shepherd has 
brought us back to the fold.
We must try to smooth away difficulties, to help on conversions, and to 
imitate the angels of God, who rejoice with Jesus in heaven over one repentant 
sinner.
