Bow your heads to God.
Guard Thy household, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, with lasting kindness, so 
that those who rely entirely upon the 
hope of heavenly grace may indeed be 
supported by heavenly protection. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
