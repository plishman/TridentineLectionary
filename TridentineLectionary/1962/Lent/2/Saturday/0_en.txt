The law of the Lord is perfect, 
refreshing the soul; the decree of the 
Lord is trustworthy, giving wisdom to 
the simple. (Ps. 18: 2) The heavens 
declare the glory of God, and the 
firmament proclaims His handiwork. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. The law of 
the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul; 
the decree of the Lord is trustworthy, 
giving wisdom to the simple.
