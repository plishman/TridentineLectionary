Give glory to the Lord, for He is good: 
for His mercy endureth for ever. Who 
shall declare the powers of the Lord: 
who shall set forth all His praises? 
Blessed are they that keep judgment 
and do justice at all times. Remember 
us, O Lord, in the favor of Thy people; 
visit us with Thy salvation.
