Remember, O Lord, Thy bowels of 
compassion, and Thy mercies that are 
from the beginning of the world, lest at 
any time our enemies rule over us: 
deliver us, O God of Israel, from all our 
tribulations. (Ps. 24: 1-2) To Thee, O 
Lord, have I lifted up my soul: in Thee, 
O my God, I put my trust: let me not be 
ashamed. Glory be to the Father and 
to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Remember, O Lord, Thy bowels of 
compassion, and Thy mercies that are 
from the beginning of the world, lest at 
any time our enemies rule over us: 
deliver us, O God of Israel, from all our 
tribulations.
