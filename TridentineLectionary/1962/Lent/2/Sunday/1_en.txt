O God, Who seest that we have no 
power whatever from ourselves, keep 
us both outwardly in our bodies and 
inwardly in our souls; that we may be 
defended from all adversities which 
may happen to the body and from all 
evil thoughts which may hurt the soul. 
Through our Lord, Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
