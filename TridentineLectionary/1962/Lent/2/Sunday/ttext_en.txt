The Mass is made up chiefly of parts of the Mass of Saturday. In the Collect 
we ask God to behold our poverty, our weakness, and our need, and implore His
help that our bodies may not succumb to outward evils, and our souls to sin.
The use of the Gospel of the Transfiguration for the second time 
emphasizes this feast. The early Roman Liturgy did not devote many festivals to
celebrating even the most important mysteries of the life and Passion of Our 
Savior, but in its annual cycle it offered to the faithful full opportunity of 
meditating, at the proper season, on all the solemn mysteries of the 
Redemption.
