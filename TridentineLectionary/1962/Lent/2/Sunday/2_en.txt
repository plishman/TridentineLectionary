Brethren: We pray and beseech you in 
the Lord Jesus that, as you have 
received from us, how you ought to 
walk and to please God, so also you 
would walk, that you may abound the 
more. For you know what precepts I 
have given to you by the Lord Jesus. 
For this is the will of God, your 
sanctification: that you should abstain 
from fornication, that every one of you 
should know how to possess his vessel
in sanctification and honor; not in the 
passion of lust, like the Gentiles that 
know not God: and that no man 
overreach nor circumvent his brother in
business: because the Lord is the 
avenger of all these things, as we have 
told you before and have testified. For 
God hath not called us unto 
uncleanness, but unto sanctification: in 
Christ Jesus our Lord.
