At that time Jesus took Peter and 
James, and John his brother, and 
bringeth them up into a high mountain 
apart: and He was transfigured before 
them. And his face did shine as the 
sun: and His garments became white 
as snow. And behold there appeared to
them Moses and Elias talking with Him.
And Peter answering, said to Jesus: 
Lord, it is good for us to be here: if 
Thou wilt, let us make here three 
tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for 
Moses, and one for Elias. And as he 
was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud
overshadowed them. And lo, a voice 
out of the cloud, saying: This is My 
beloved Son, in Whom I am well 
pleased: hear ye Him. And the disciples
hearing, fell upon their face and were 
very much afraid. And Jesus came and 
touched them, and said to them: Arise, 
and fear not. And they lifting up their 
eyes saw no one, but only Jesus. And 
as they came down from the mountain, 
Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the 
vision to no man till the Son of Man be 
risen from the dead.
