Forsake me not, O Lord my God, do 
not Thou depart from me; attend unto 
my help, O Lord, the power of my 
salvation. (Ps. 37: 2) Rebuke me not, O
Lord, in Thy indignation: nor chastise 
me in Thy wrath. Glory be to the Father
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now and 
ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God, do 
not Thou depart from me; attend unto 
my help, O Lord, the power of my 
salvation.
