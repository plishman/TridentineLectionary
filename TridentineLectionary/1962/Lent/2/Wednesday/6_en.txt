At that time, Jesus going up to 
Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples 
apart, and said to them, Behold, we go 
up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man 
shall be betrayed to the chief priests 
and the scribes, and they shall 
condemn Him to death, and shall 
deliver Him to the gentiles to be 
mocked, and scourged, and crucified: 
and the third day He shall rise again. 
Then came to Him the mother of the 
sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring
and asking something of Him. Who 
said to her, What wilt thou? She saith to
Him, Say that these my two sons may 
sit, the one on Thy right hand, and the 
other on Thy left, in Thy kingdom. And 
Jesus answering, said, You know not 
what you ask. Can you drink the 
chalice that I shall drink? They say to 
Him, We can. He saith to them, My 
chalice indeed you shall drink: but to sit
on My right or left hand, is not Mine to 
give to you, but to them for whom it is 
prepared by My Father. And the ten 
hearing it, were moved with indignation 
against the two brethren. But Jesus 
called them to Him, and said, You know
that the princes of the Gentiles lord it 
over them; and they that are the 
greater, exercise power upon them. It 
shall not be so among you: but 
whosoever will be the greater among 
you, let him be your minister; and he 
that will be first among you, shall be 
your servant. Even as the Son of man 
is not come to be ministered unto, but 
to minister, and to give His life a 
redemption for many.
