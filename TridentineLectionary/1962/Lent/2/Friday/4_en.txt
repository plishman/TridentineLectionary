O Lord, deal with us not according to 
our sins, nor requite us according to 
our crimes. (Ps. 78: 8-9) O Lord, 
remember not against us the iniquities 
of the past; may Thy compassion 
quickly come to us, for we are brought 
very low. (Kneel.) Help us, O God, our 
Saviour, because of the glory of Thy 
Name, O Lord; deliver us and pardon 
our sins for Thy Nameâ€™s sake.
