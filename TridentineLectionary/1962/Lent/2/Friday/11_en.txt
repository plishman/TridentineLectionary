Bow your heads to God. 
Grant unto Thy people, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, health of mind and body,
that, by persevering in good works, we 
may be worthy to be protected by Your 
mighty power. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
