At that time, Jesus spoke this parable 
to the multitude of the Jews and the 
chief priests: There was a man, a 
householder, who planted a vineyard, 
and put a hedge about it, and dug a 
wine vat in it, and built a tower; then he 
let it out to vinedressers, and went 
abroad. But when the fruit season 
drew near, he sent his servants to the 
vinedressers to receive his fruits. And 
the vinedressers seized his servants, 
and beat one, killed another, and 
stoned another. Again he sent another 
party of servants more numerous than 
the first; and they did the same to 
these. Finally he sent his son to them, 
saying: They will respect my son. But
the vinedressers, on seeing the son, 
said among themselves: This is the 
heir; come, let us kill him, and we shall 
have his inheritance. So they seized 
him, cast him out of the vineyard, and 
killed him. When, therefore, the owner 
of the vineyard comes, what will he do 
to those vinedressers? They said to 
Him: He will utterly destroy those evil 
men, and will let out the vineyard to 
other vinedressers, who will render to
him the fruits in their seasons. Jesus 
said to them: Did you never read in the 
Scriptures: The stone which the 
builders rejected, has become the 
cornerstone; by the Lord this has been 
done, and it is wonderful in our eyes? 
Therefore I say to you, that the 
kingdom of God will be taken away 
from you and will be given to a people 
yielding its fruits. And he who falls on 
this stone will be broken to pieces; but 
upon whomever it falls, it will grind him 
to powder. And when the chief priests 
and Pharisees had heard His parables,
they knew that He was speaking about 
them. And though they sought to lay 
hands on Him, they feared the people, 
because they regarded Him as a 
prophet.
