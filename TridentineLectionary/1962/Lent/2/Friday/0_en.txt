But I in justice shall behold Thy face; I
shall be content when Thy glory shall
appear. (Ps. 16: 1) Hear, O Lord, my 
justice; attend to my cry. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. But I in justice shall 
behold Thy face; I shall be content 
when Thy glory shall appear.
