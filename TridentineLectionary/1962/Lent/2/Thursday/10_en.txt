Bow down your heads to God.
Be present with Thy servants, O Lord, 
and shower perpetual kindness upon 
those who ask it; that to those, who 
glory in Thee, their creator and ruler, 
Thou mayest restore good things 
heaped up, and preserve what Thou 
dost restore. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
