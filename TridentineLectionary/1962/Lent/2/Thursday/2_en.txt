Thus saith the Lord God: Cursed be 
the man that trusteth in man, and 
maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart 
departeth from the Lord. For he shall 
be like tamaric in the desert, and he 
shall not see when good shall come: 
but he shall dwell in dryness in the 
desert, in a salt land, and not inhabited.
Blessed be the man that trusteth in the 
Lord, and the Lord shall be his 
confidence. And he shall be as a tree 
that is planted by the waters, that 
spreadeth out its roots towards 
moisture; and it shall not fear when the 
heat cometh. And the leaf thereof shall
be green, and in the time of drought it 
shall not be solicitous, neither shall it 
cease at time to bring forth fruit. The 
heart is perverse above all things, and 
unsearchable; who can know it? I am 
the Lord Who search the heart, and 
prove the reins: Who give to one 
according to his way, and according to 
the fruit of his devices: saith the Lord 
almighty.
