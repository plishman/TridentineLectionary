O God, come to my assistance; O Lord,
make haste to help me: let my enemies
be confounded and ashamed that seek
my soul. (Ps. 69: 4) Let them be turned 
backward and blush for shame, that 
desire evils to me. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. O God, come to my 
assistance; O Lord, make haste to help
me: let my enemies be confounded and
ashamed that seek my soul.
