Grant us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
the assistance of Thy grace, that, being
intent, as becometh us, upon fasting 
and prayer, we may be delivered from 
the enemies of soul and of body. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
