At that time Jesus said to the 
Pharisees: There was a certain rich 
man who was clothed in purple and fine
linen, and feasted sumptuously every 
day. And there was a certain beggar, 
named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full
of sores, desiring to be filled with the 
crumbs that fell from the rich man's 
table, and no one did give him: 
moreover the dogs came and licked his
sores. And it came to pass that the 
beggar died, and was carried by the 
angels into Abraham's bosom. And the 
rich man also died, and he was buried 
in hell. And lifting up his eyes when he 
was in torments, he saw Abraham afar 
off, and Lazarus in his bosom, and he 
cried and said: Father Abraham, have 
mercy on me, and send Lazarus that 
he may dip the tip of his finger in water 
to cool my tongue, for I am tormented 
in this flame. And Abraham said to him: 
Son, remember that thou didst receive 
good things in thy lifetime and likewise 
Lazarus evil things: but now his is 
comforted and thou art tormented. And 
besides all this, between us and you 
there is fixed a great chaos: so that 
they who would pass from hence to you
cannot, nor from hence come hither. 
And he said: Then, father, I beseech 
thee that thou wouldst send him to my 
father's house, for I have five brethren, 
that he may testify unto them, lest they 
also come into this place of torments. 
And Abraham said to him: They have 
Moses and the prophets: let them hear 
them. But he said: No, Father 
Abraham: but if one went to them from 
the dead, they will do penance. And he 
said to him: If they hear not Moses and 
the prophets, neither will they believe if 
one rise again from the dead.
