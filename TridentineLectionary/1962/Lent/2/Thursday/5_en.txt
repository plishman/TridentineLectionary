Moses prayed in the sight of the Lord 
his God, and said: Why, O Lord, art 
Thou angry with Thy people? let the 
anger of Thy soul be appeased: 
remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
to whom Thou sworest that Thou 
wouIdst give the land flowing with milk 
and honey. And the Lord was appeased
from the evil which He had threatened 
to do to His people.
