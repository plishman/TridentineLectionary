Deliver me, O Lord, from my 
necessities; see my abjection and my 
labor; and forgive me all my sins. (Ps. 
24: 1-2) To Thee, O Lord, have I lifted 
up my soul: in Thee, O my God, I put 
my trust; let me not be ashamed. Glory
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Deliver me, 
O Lord, from my necessities; see my 
abjection and my labor; and forgive me 
all my sins.
