At that time there was a festival day of 
the Jews, and Jesus went up to 
Jerusalem. Now there is at Jerusalem a
pond, called Probatica, which in 
Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having 
five porches. In these lay a great 
multitude of sick, of blind, of lame,
of withered; waiting for the moving of 
the water. And an Angel of the Lord 
descended at certain times into the 
pond; and the water was moved. And 
he that went down first into the pond 
after the motion of the water, was made
whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay 
under. And there was a certain man 
there, that had been eight and thirty 
years under his infirmity. Him when 
Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he
had been now a long time, He saith to 
him: Wilt thou be made whole? The 
infirm man answered Him: Sir, I have 
no man, when the water is troubled, to 
put me into the pond. For whilst I am 
coming, another goeth down before 
me. Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up 
thy bed, and walk. And immediately 
the man was made whole: and he took
up his bed, and walked. And it was the 
sabbath that day. The Jews therefore 
said to him that was healed: It is the 
sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take 
up thy bed. He answered them: He that
made me whole, He said to me, Take 
up thy bed, and walk. They asked him
therefore: Who is that man who said to 
thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? But 
he who was healed, knew not who it 
was; for Jesus went aside from the 
multitude standing in the place. 
Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the 
temple, and saith to him: Behold thou 
art made whole: sin no more, lest some
worse thing happen to thee. The man 
went his way, and told the Jews, that it 
was Jesus who had made him whole.
