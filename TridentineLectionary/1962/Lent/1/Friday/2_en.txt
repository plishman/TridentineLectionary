Thus saith the Lord God: The soul that
sinneth, the same shall die: the son 
shall not bear the iniquity of the father, 
and the father shall not bear the iniquity
of the son: the justice of the just shall 
be upon him, and the wickedness of 
the wicked shall be upon him. But if the
wicked do penance for all his sins 
which he hath committed, and keep all 
my commandments, and do judgment, 
and justice, living he shall live, and 
shall not die. I will not remember all his 
iniquities that he hath done: in his 
justice which he hath wrought, he shall 
live. Is it My will that a sinner should 
die, saith the Lord God, and not
that he should be converted from his 
ways, and live? But if the just man turn 
himself away from his justice, and do 
iniquity according to all the 
abominations which the wicked man 
useth to work, shall he live? All his 
justices which he hath done, shall
not be remembered: in the 
prevarication, by which he hath 
prevaricated, and in his sin, which he 
hath committed, in them he shall die. 
And you have said: The way of the 
Lord is not right. Hear ye, therefore, O
house of Israel: Is it My way that is not
right, and are not rather your ways 
perverse? For when the just turneth 
himself away from his justice, and 
committeth iniquity, he shall die therein:
in the injustice that he hath wrought he 
shall die. And when the wicked turneth 
himself away from his wickedness, 
which he hath wrought, and doeth 
judgment, and justice: he shall save 
his soul alive. Because he
considereth and turneth away himself 
from all his iniquities which he hath 
wrought, he shall surely live, and not 
die, saith the Lord almighty.
