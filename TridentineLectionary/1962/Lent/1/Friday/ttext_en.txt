The Liturgy insists on the necessity of a reformation of life. When baptism 
was administered to adults, it was expected that the sacrament should effect in 
the catechumen a complete change of heart. The Pool of Bethsaida, of which
the Gospel (John 5, 1-15) speaks, symbolizes the baptismal font of the 
catechumens, and is, to all the faithful, a figure of the adorable Heart of Jesus, 
through Whose wounded side they pass into an ocean of love and compassion.
