Thus says the Lord God: I Myself will 
look after and tend My sheep. As a 
shepherd tends his flock when he finds 
himself among his scattered sheep, so 
will I tend My sheep. I will rescue them 
from every place where they were 
scattered when it was cloudy and dark. 
I will lead them out from among the 
peoples and gather them from the 
foreign lands; I will bring them back to 
their own country and pasture them 
upon the mountains of Israel in the 
landâ€™s ravines and all its inhabited 
places. In good pastures will I pasture 
them, and on the mountain heights of 
Israel shall be their grazing ground. 
There they shall lie down on good 
grazing ground, and in rich pastures 
shall they be pastured on the 
mountains of Israel. I Myself will 
pasture My sheep; I Myself will give 
them rest, says the Lord God. The lost I
will seek out, the strayed I will bring 
back, the injured I will bind up, the sick 
I will heal, and that which is fat strong I 
will preserve, and I will feed them in 
judgment, says the Lord almighty.
