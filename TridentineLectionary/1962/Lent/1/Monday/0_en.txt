As the eyes of servants are on the 
hands of their masters, so are our 
eyes on the Lord, our God, till He have 
mercy on us. Have mercy on us, O 
Lord, have mercy on us. (Ps. 122: 1) 
To Thee I lift up my eyes, Who are 
enthroned in heaven. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. As the eyes of servants 
are on the hands of their masters, so 
are our eyes on the Lord, our God, till 
He have mercy on us. Have mercy on 
us, O Lord, have mercy on us.
