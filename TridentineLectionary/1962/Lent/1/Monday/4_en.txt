O Lord, repay us not according to the 
sins we have committed, nor according 
to our iniquities. ( Ps. 78: 8-9) O Lord, 
remember not our former iniquities, let 
Thy mercies speedily prevent us; for 
we are become exceeding poor. (Here 
kneel.) Help us, O God, our Savior, 
and for the glory of Thy name, O Lord, 
deliver us: and forgive us our sins for 
Thy name's sake.
