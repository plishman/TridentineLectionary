At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
When the Son of Man shall come in His
majesty, and all the angels with Him, 
then He will sit on the throne of His 
glory; and before Him will be gathered 
all the nations, and He will separate 
them one from another, as the 
shepherd separates the sheep from the
goats; and He will set the sheep on His 
right hand, but the goats on the left. 
Then the king will say to those on his 
right hand: Come, blessed of My 
Father, take possession of the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of
the world; for I was hungry and you 
gave Me to eat; I was thirsty and you 
gave Me to drink; I was a stranger and 
you took Me in; naked and you covered
Me; sick and you visited Me; I was in 
prison and you came to Me. Then the 
just will answer Him, saying: Lord, 
when did we see Thee hungry, and 
feed Thee; or thirsty, and give Thee to 
drink? And when did we see Thee a 
stranger, and take Thee in; or naked, 
and clothe Thee? Or when did we see 
Thee sick, or in prison, and come to 
Thee? And, answering, the king will 
say to them: Amen I say to you, as long
as you did it for one of these, the least 
of My brethren, you did it for Me. Then 
He will say to those on His left hand: 
Depart from Me, accursed ones, into 
the everlasting fire which was prepared
for the devil and his angels. For I was 
hungry, and you did not give Me to eat; 
I was thirsty and you gave Me no 
drink; I was a stranger and you did not 
take Me in; naked, and you did not 
clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you 
did not visit Me. Then they also will and
say: Lord, when did we see Thee 
hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or 
naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not 
minister to Thee? Then He will answer 
them, saying: Amen I say to you, as 
long as you did not do it for one of 
these least ones, you did not do it for 
Me. And these will go into everlasting, 
punishment, but the just into 
everlasting life.
