Bow down your heads before God.
Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, to all 
Christian people, that they may 
understand what they profess, and love
the heavenly Gift which they frequent. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
