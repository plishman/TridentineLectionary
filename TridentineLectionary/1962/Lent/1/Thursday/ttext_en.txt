The Mass dwells on fasting and prayer. The Gospel recalls the woman of 
Chanaan who, by humility and perseverance in prayer, obtained the cure of her 
daughter. Our Lord at first appeared to refuse to perform a miracle in favor of a
Gentile woman. The cure of her daughter showed the mercy of God calling to 
penance the Chanaanite and the publican.
