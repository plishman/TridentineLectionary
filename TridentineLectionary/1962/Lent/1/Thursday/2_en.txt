In those days, the word of the Lord 
came to me, saying: What is the 
meaning that you use among you this 
parable as a proverb in the land of 
Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten 
sour grapes, and the teeth of the 
children are set on edge. As I live, saith
the Lord God, this parable shall
be no more to you a proverb in Israel.
Behold all souls are mine: as the soul 
of the father, so also the soul of the son
is mine: the soul that sinneth, the same
shall die. And if a man be just, and do 
judgment and justice, and hath not 
eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up
his eyes to the idols of the house of 
Israel: and hath not defiled his 
neighbor's wife, nor come near
to a menstruous woman: And hath not
wronged any man: but hath restored 
the pledge to the debtor, hath taken 
nothing away by violence: hath given 
his bread to the hungry, and hath 
covered the naked with a garment: 
Hath not lent upon usury, nor taken any
increase: hath withdrawn his hand from
iniquity, and hath executed true 
judgment between man and man: Hath
walked in my commandments, and kept
my judgments, to do truth: he is just, he
shall surely live, saith the Lord 
almighty.
