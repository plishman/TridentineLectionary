Look down favorably, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, upon the devotion of Thy
people, that they whose bodies are 
mortified by abstinence, may through 
the fruit of good works be refreshed in 
mind. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
