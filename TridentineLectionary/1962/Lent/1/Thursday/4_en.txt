At that time Jesus went from thence, 
and retired into the coasts of Tyre and 
Sidon. And behold a woman of 
Canaan who came out of those coasts,
crying out, said to him: Have mercy on 
me, O Lord, thou son of David: my 
daughter is grievously troubled by the 
devil. Who answered her not a word. 
And his disciples came and besought 
him, saying: Send her away, for she 
crieth after us: And he answering, said: 
I was not sent
but to the sheep that are lost of the 
house of Israel. But she came and 
adored him, saying: Lord, help me. 
Who answering, said: It is not good to 
take the bread of the children, and to 
cast it to the dogs. But she said: Yea, 
Lord; for the whelps also eat of the 
crumbs that fall from the table of their
masters. Then Jesus answering, said 
to her: O woman, great is thy faith: be 
it done to thee as thou wilt: and her 
daughter was cured from that hour.
