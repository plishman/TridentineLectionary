Bow your heads to God.
O Lord, we beseech You, shed light 
upon our minds by the brightness of 
Your glory, so that we may see what we
must do and have strength to do what 
is right. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
