The ancient Roman sources speak of only three ember fasts, without one in 
spring. Perhaps the actual fixing of these three spring ember days (W,F,S) in 
this sixth week before Easter dates from a time when the paschal fast began 
only three weeks before the great festival of Easter.
The first Collect and Lesson, in this time of fast and on this ancient 
catechetical day, evoked the remembrance of Mount Horeb where Moses dwelt 
for forty days, fasting and conversing with God in order to receive from Him the 
Tables of the Law.
The second Lesson tells of the wonder-working bread which fortified the 
prophet Elias: a type of the Eucharist, the true unleavened bread of 
mortification which, as the Scripture says, purifies the soul and leads it to the 
height of Calvary.
