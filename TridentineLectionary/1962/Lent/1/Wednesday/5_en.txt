In those days Elias came to Bersabee 
of Juda, and left his servant there, and 
he went forward, one day's journey into
the desert. And when he was there, 
and sat under a juniper-tree, he 
requested for his soul that he might die,
and said, It is enough for me, Lord, 
take away my soul, for I am no better 
than my fathers. And he cast himself 
down, and slept in the shadow of the 
juniper-tree; and behold an angel of the
Lord touched him, and said to him, 
Arise and eat. He looked, and, behold, 
there was at his head a hearth-cake 
and a vessel of water, and he ate and 
drank, and fell asleep again. And the 
angel of the Lord came again the 
second time, and touched him, and 
said to him, Arise, eat, for thou hast yet 
a great way to go. And he arose, and 
ate and drank, and walked in the 
strength of that food forty days and 
forty nights, unto the mount of God, 
Horeb.
