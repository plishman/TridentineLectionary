Deliver me from my necessities, O 
Lord: see my abjection and my labor, 
and forgive me all my sins. To Thee, O
Lord, have I lifted up my soul: in Thee, 
O my God, I put my trust, let me not be 
ashamed: neither let my enemies laugh
at me. For none of them that wait on 
Thee shall be confounded: let all them 
be confounded that do vain things.
