In those days, the Lord said to Moses, 
Come up to me into the mount, and be 
there; and I will give thee tables of 
stone, and the law, and the 
commandments which I have written 
that thou mayest teach the children of 
Israel. Moses rose up, and his minister 
Josue; and Moses going up into the 
mount of God, said to the ancients, 
Wait ye here till we return to you. You 
have Aaron and Hur with you; if any 
question shall arise, you shall refer it to 
them. And when Moses was gone up, a
cloud covered the mount; and the glory 
of the Lord dwelt upon Sinai, covering it
with a cloud six days: and the seventh 
day He called him out of the midst of 
the cloud. And the sight of the glory of 
the Lord was like a burning fire upon 
the top of the mount, in the eyes of the 
children of Israel. And Moses entering 
into the midst of the cloud, went up into
the mountain: and he was there forty 
days and forty nights.
