Behold with kindness, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, the devotion of Thy 
people, that they, who now are 
mortified in body by abstinence, may 
be refreshed in soul by the fruit of their 
good work. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
