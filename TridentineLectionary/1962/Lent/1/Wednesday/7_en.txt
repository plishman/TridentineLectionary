At that time some of the scribes and 
Pharisees answered Jesus saying: 
Master, we would see a sign from 
Thee. Who answering said to them: An 
evil and adulterous generation seeketh 
a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, 
but the sign of Jonas the prophet. For 
as Jonas was in the whale's belly three 
days and three nights: so shall the Son 
of Man be in the heart of the earth 
three days and three nights. The men 
of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with 
this generation, and shall condemn it; 
because they did penance at the 
preaching of Jonas. And behold a 
greater than Jonas here. The queen of 
the south shall rise in judgment with 
this generation, and shall condemn it: 
because she came from the ends of the
earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, 
and behold a greater than Solomon 
here. And when an unclean spirit is 
gone out of a man, he walketh through 
dry places, seeking rest, and findeth 
none. Then he saith: I will return into 
my house from whence I came out. And
coming he findeth it empty, swept, and 
garnished. Then he goeth, and taketh 
with him seven other spirits more 
wicked than himself, and they enter in 
and dwell there: and the last state of 
that man is made worse than the first. 
So shall it be also to this wicked 
generation. As He was yet speaking to 
the multitudes, behold His mother and 
His brethren stood without, seeking to 
speak to Him. And one said unto Him: 
Behold Thy mother and Thy brethren 
stand without, seeking Thee. But He 
answering him that told Him, said: Who
is My mother and who are My 
brethren? And stretching forth His 
hands towards His disciples, he said: 
Behold My mother and My brethren. 
For whosoever shall do the will of My 
Father that is in Heaven, he is My 
brother, and sister, and mother.
