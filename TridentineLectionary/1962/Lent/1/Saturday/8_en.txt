In those days all the priests made 
prayer, while the sacrifice was 
consuming, Jonathan beginning, and 
the rest answering. And the prayer of 
Nehemias was after this manner: O 
Lord God, Creator of all things, dreadful
and strong, just and merciful, Who 
alone art the good king, Who alone art 
gracious, Who alone art just, and 
almighty, and eternal, who deliverest 
Israel from all evil, Who didst choose 
the fathers and didst sanctify them: 
receive the sacrifice for all Thy people 
Israel, and preserve Thine own portion,
and sanctify it; that the Gentiles may 
know that thou art our God.
