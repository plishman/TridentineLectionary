Go before our actions, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, with Thine inspirations 
and further them by Thine assistance; 
that every word and work of ours may 
begin always from Thee and by Thee 
be likewise ended. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
