Brethren: we beseech you, rebuke the 
unquiet, comfort the feeble-minded, 
support the weak, be patient towards 
all men. See that none render evil for 
evil to any man; but ever follow that 
which is good towards each other, and 
towards all men. Always rejoice. Pray 
without ceasing. In all things give 
thanks; for this is the will of God in
Christ Jesus concerning you all. 
Extinguish not the spirit. Despise not 
prophecies. But prove all things; hold 
fast that which is good. From all 
appearance of evil refrain yourselves. 
And may the God of peace himself 
sanctify you in all things; that your
whole spirit, and soul, and body, may 
be preserved blameless in the coming 
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
