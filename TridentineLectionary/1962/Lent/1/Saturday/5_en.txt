In those days Moses said to the 
children of Israel: If you keep the 
commandments which I command you,
and do them, to love the Lord your 
God, and walk in all His ways, cleaving 
unto Him, the Lord will destroy all these
nations before your face, and shall 
possess them, which are greater and 
stronger than you. Every place that 
your foot shall tread upon be yours. 
From the desert, and from Libanus, 
from the great river Euphrates unto the 
western sea shall be your borders. 
None shall stand against you: the Lord 
your God shall lay the dread and fear of
you upon all the land that you shall 
tread upon, as He hath spoken to you, 
the Lord your God.
