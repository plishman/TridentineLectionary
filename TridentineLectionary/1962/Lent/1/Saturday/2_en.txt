In those days Moses spoke to the 
people, saying: When thou hast made 
an end of tithing all thy fruits, in the 
third year of tithes thou shalt give it to 
the Levite, and to the stranger, and to 
the fatherless, and to the widow, that 
they may eat within thy gates, and be 
filled: And thou shalt speak thus in the 
sight of the Lord thy God: I have taken 
that which was sanctified out of my 
house, and I have given it to the 
Levite, and to the stranger, and to the 
fatherless, and to the widow, as Thou 
hast commanded me: I have not 
transgressed thy commandments nor 
forgotten thy precepts. I have obeyed 
the voice of the Lord my God, and have
done all things as Thou hast 
commanded me. Look from Thy
sanctuary, and Thy high habitation of 
heaven, and bless Thy people Israel, 
and the land which Thou hast given us,
as Thou didst swear to our fathers, a 
land flowing with milk and honey. This 
day the Lord thy God hath commanded
Thee to do these commandments and 
judgments: and to keep and fulfil them
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. 
Thou hast chosen the Lord this day to 
be thy God, and to walk in His ways 
and keep his ceremonies, and 
precepts, and judgments, and obey His
command. And the Lord hath chosen 
Thee this day, to be His particular 
people, as he hath spoken to Thee, 
and to keep all his commandments: 
and to make Thee higher than all 
nations which He hath created, to His 
own praise, and name, and glory: that 
thou mayst be a holy people of the Lord
thy God, as He hath spoken.
