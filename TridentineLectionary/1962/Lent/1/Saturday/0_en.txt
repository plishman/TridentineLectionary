Let my prayers come in before Thee: 
incline Thine ear to my petition, O 
Lord. (Ps. 87: 2) O Lord, the God of my
salvation: I have cried in the day and in 
the night before Thee. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Let my prayers come in 
before Thee: incline Thine ear to my 
petition, O Lord.
