Graciously hear the prayers of Thy 
people, we beseech Thee, O Lord: 
that we, who are justly afflicted for our 
sins, may for the glory of Thy name be 
mercifully delivered. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
