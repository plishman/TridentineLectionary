Have mercy upon us, O God of all, and 
behold us, and shew us the light of Thy
mercies: And send Thy fear upon the 
nations, that have not sought after 
thee: that they may know that there is 
no God beside thee, and that they may 
shew forth Thy wonders. Lift up Thy 
hand over the strange nations, that 
they may see Thy power. For as Thou 
hast been sanctified in us in their sight, 
so Thou shalt be magnified among 
them in our presence, That
they may know thee, as we also have
known thee, that there is no God 
beside thee, O Lord. Renew Thy signs, 
and work new miracles. Glorify Thy 
hand, and Thy right arm. Raise up 
indignation, and pour out wrath. Take 
away the adversary, and crush the 
enemy. Hasten the time, and 
remember the end, that they may 
declare Thy wonderful works, O Lord, 
our God.
