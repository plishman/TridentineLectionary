Lord, Thou hast been our refuge 
through all generations; from eternity 
and to eternity Thou art (Ps. 89: 2) 
Before the mountains were begotten 
and the earth and the world were 
brought forth, from eternity and to
eternity Thou art God. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen.
