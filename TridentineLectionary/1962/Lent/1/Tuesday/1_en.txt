Look upon Thy household, O Lord, and
grant that our minds, chastened by 
mortification of the flesh, may, because 
of their desire for Thee, shine in Thy 
sight. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
(for St. Gregory)
O God, Who hast conferred the 
rewards of everlasting happiness upon 
the soul of Thy servant Gregory, 
mercifully grant that we, who are 
oppressed by the burden of our sins, 
may be relieved by his prayers to Thee.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
