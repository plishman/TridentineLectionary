In those days, the prophet Isaiah 
spoke, saying: Seek the Lord while He 
may be found, call Him while He is 
near. Let the scoundrel forsake his way,
and the wicked man his thoughts; let 
him turn to the Lord for mercy; to our 
God, Who is generous in forgiving. For 
My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor
are your ways My ways, says the Lord. 
And high as the heavens are above 
your ways and My thoughts above your
thoughts. For just as from the heavens 
the rain and snow come down and do 
not return there till they have watered 
the earth, making it fertile and fruitful, 
giving seed to him who sows and bread
to him who eats, so shall My word be 
that goes forth from My mouth; it shall 
not return to Me void, but shall do My 
will, achieving the end for which I sent 
it, says the Lord almighty.
