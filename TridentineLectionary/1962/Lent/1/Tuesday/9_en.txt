We beseech Thee, almighty God, that 
we may obtain the effect of that 
salvation whose pledge we have 
received through these mysteries. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(for St. Gregory)
O God, Who didst make Thy bishop 
Gregory equal with the saints in merit, 
favorably grant that we, who faithfully 
keep the feast of his commemoration, 
may also imitate the examples set by 
his life. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
