At that time, when Jesus entered 
Jerusalem, all the city was thrown into 
commotion, saying: Who is this? But 
the crowds kept on saying: This is 
Jesus the prophet from Nazareth of 
Galilee. And Jesus entered the temple 
of God, and cast out all those who
were selling and buying in the temple, 
and He overturned the tables of the 
moneychangers and the seats of those 
who sold the doves. And He said to 
them: It is written: My house shall be 
called a house of prayer; but you have 
make it a den of thieves. And the blind 
and the lame came to Him in the 
temple, and He healed them. But the 
chief priests and the Scribes, seeing 
the wonderful deeds that He did, and 
the children crying out in the temple, 
and saying: Hosanna to the Son of 
David, were indignant, and said to Him:
Hearest Thou what these are saying? 
And Jesus said to them: Yes; have you 
never read: Out of the
mouth of infants and sucklings Thou 
hast perfected praise? And leaving 
them, He went out of the city to 
Bethany and He stayed there.
