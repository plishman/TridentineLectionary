Be appeased, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, by the gifts we offer, and 
safeguard us from all dangers. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(for St. Gregory)
Suffer, we beseech Thee, O Lord, that 
through the intercession of blessed 
Gregory this oblation may profit us; for 
by its offering Thou hast granted that 
the sins of all the world should be 
pardoned. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
