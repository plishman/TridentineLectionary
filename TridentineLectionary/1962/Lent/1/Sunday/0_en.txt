He shall cry to me, and I will hear him: I
will deliver him, and I will glorify him: I 
will fill him with length of days. (Ps. 
90: 1) He that dwelleth in the aid of the 
Most High shall abide under the 
protection of the God of Heaven. Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. He shall cry 
to me, and I will hear him: I will deliver 
him, and I will glorify him: I will fill him 
with length of days.
