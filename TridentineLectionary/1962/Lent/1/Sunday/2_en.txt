Brethren: We exhort you that you 
receive not the grace of God in vain. 
For He saith: In an accepted time have 
I heard thee, and in the day of salvation
have I helped thee. Behold, now is the 
acceptable time, behold now is the day 
of salvation. Giving no offense to any 
man, that our ministry be not blamed: 
but in all things let us exhibit ourselves 
as the ministers of God, in much 
patience, in tribulation, in necessities, 
in distress, in stripes, in prisons, in 
seditions, in labors, in watchings, in 
fastings, in chastity, in knowledge, in 
long-suffering, in sweetness, in the 
Holy Spirit, in charity unfeigned, in the 
word of truth, in the power of God: by 
the armor of justice on the right hand 
and on the left: by honor and dishonor, 
by evil report and good report: as 
deceivers and yet true, as unknown 
and yet known: as dying, and behold 
we live: as chastised and not killed: as 
sorrowful, yet always rejoicing: as 
needy, yet enriching many: as having 
nothing and possessing all things.
