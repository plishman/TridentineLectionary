He that dwelleth in the aid of the most 
High shall abide under the protection of
the God of heaven. He shall say to the 
Lord: Thou art my protector and my 
refuge: my God, in Him will I trust. For 
He hath delivered me from the snare of
the hunters, and from the sharp word. 
He will overshadow thee with His 
shoulders, and under His wings thou 
shalt trust. His truth shall compass 
thee with a shield: thou shalt not be 
afraid of the terror of the night. Of the 
arrow that flieth in the day, of the 
business that walketh about in the dark,
of invasion or of the noonday devil. A 
thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten 
thousand at thy right hand: but it shall 
not come nigh thee. . For He hath given
His angels charge over thee, to keep 
thee in all thy ways. In their hands they
shall bear thee up, lest thou dash thy 
foot against a stone. Thou shalt walk 
upon the asp and the basilisk, and thou
shalt trample under foot the lion and 
the dragon. Because he hoped in Me I 
will deliver him: I will protect him, 
because he hath known My name. He 
shall cry to Me, and I will hear him: I am
with him in tribulation. I will deliver him,
and I will glorify him: I will fill him with 
length of days, and I will show him My 
salvation.
