O God, who dost purify Thy Church by
the yearly observance of forty days; 
grant to Thy household that what we 
strive to obtain from Thee by self 
denial, we may secure by good works. 
Through our Lord, Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
