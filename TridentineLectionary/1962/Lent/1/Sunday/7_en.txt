We solemnly offer Thee, O Lord, the 
sacrifice of the beginning of Lent, 
beseeching Thee, that by refraining 
from carnal feasts, we may learn to 
avoid sinful pleasures. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
