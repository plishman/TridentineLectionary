St. Peter's is the ancient liturgical cathedral of the Roman Pontiffs, who 
repair there to officiate on all the great festivals, but the habitual seat, the normal
residence of the Popes, is the Lateran, and for this reason the Basilica 
Salvatoris (Basilica of the Savior - St. John Lateran) can claim the title of Mother
and Head of all the churches of the city and of the world.
In the Mass for this Sunday great prominence is given to Psalm 90, that 
psalm which was quoted by Satan when tempting Our Lord. The faithful should 
contemplate with special devotion the mystery of Christ tempted in the desert, 
for there is no other which shows more clearly how the divine Providence 
makes even the wiles of the devil serve to our sanctification.
Although the faithful have already been fasting for four days, it is only to-day
that the Liturgy celebrates the beginning of Lent, for until this Sunday nothing 
has been changed either in the divine Office or in the Mass. The proper Preface
and other ,prayers are now used and the Lenten forms are followed til the 
divine Office.
