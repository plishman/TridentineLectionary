Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord our 
God, that through the intercession of 
the Saints, the Sacraments we have 
celebrated on their festival may avail us
unto salvation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, our 
God: that as we rejoice on earth in 
keeping the memory of Thy Saints, so 
also we may enjoy their company for 
evermore. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
