O God, Who knowest that we exist by 
no power of our own: mercifully grant 
that, by the intercession of blessed 
Martin, Thy Confessor and Bishop, we 
be strengthened against all 
adversities. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God: that we, who celebrate the 
heavenly birthday of Mennas, Thy 
Martyr, may, through his intercession, 
be strengthened in the love of Thy 
Name. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
