Hallow, we beseech Thee, O Lord God,
these gifts, which we offer on the 
festival of Thy holy Bishop Martin: that 
through them our life may always be 
guided both in prosperity and in 
adversity. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Receive our gifts, and our prayers, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord; cleanse us by 
the heavenly Mysteries and mercifully 
hear us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
