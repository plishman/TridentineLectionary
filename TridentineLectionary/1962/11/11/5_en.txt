At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
No man lighteth a candle, and putteth it
in a hidden place, nor under a bushel: 
but upon a candlestick, that they that 
come in may see the light. The light of 
thy body is thine eye. If thine eye be 
single, thy whole body will be 
lightsome; but if it be evil, thy body also
will be darksome. Take heed therefore 
that the light which is in thee be not 
darkness. If then thy whole body be
lightsome, having no part of darkness, 
the whole shall be lightsome, and as a 
bright lamp shall enlighten thee.
