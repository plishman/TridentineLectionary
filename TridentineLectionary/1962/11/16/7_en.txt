May the offering of Thy consecrated 
people be accepted by Thee, O Lord, 
in honor of Thy saints, by whose merits
it knoweth that it hath received aid in 
time of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
