O God, Who didst prepare for Thyself a
pleasant dwelling-place in the heart of 
blessed Gertrude, do Thou, through 
her merits and intercession, mercifully 
wipe away from our hearts every stain 
of sin, and grant us to enjoy her 
companionship. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
