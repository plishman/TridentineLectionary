O God, the bestower of pardon and 
lover of man's salvation, we beseech 
Thy clemency, through the intercession
blessed Mary ever a virgin, and all Thy 
Saints, that the brethren who have 
passed out of this world may together 
enjoy everlasting happiness. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
