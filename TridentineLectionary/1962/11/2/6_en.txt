At that time, Jesus said to the 
multitudes of the Jews, I am the living 
bread, which came down from heaven. 
If any man eat of this bread he shall 
live forever: and the bread that I will 
give is My flesh for the life of the world. 
The Jews therefore strove among 
themselves, saying, How can this man 
give us His flesh to eat? Then Jesus 
said to them, Amen , amen, I say unto 
you, except you eat the flesh of the 
Son of man, and drink His blood, you 
shall not have life in you. He that eateth
My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath 
everlasting life and I will raise him up in
the last day.
