O God, Whose mercy is boundless, 
mercifully receive the prayers of our 
lowliness, and grant, through these 
Sacraments of our salvation, to the 
souls of all the faithful departed, to 
whom Thou didst grant the confession 
of Thy name, the remission of all sins. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
