Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
and merciful God, that the souls of Thy 
servants and handmaidens, for whom 
we have offered this sacrifice of praise 
to Thy majesty, being purified of all sins
by the virtue of this sacrament, may, by
Thy mercy, receive the beatitude of 
perpetual light. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
