Should November 2 fall on Sunday, the commemoration of All Souls is 
transferred to the following Monday. Pope Benedict XV granted priests 
permission to offer three Masses on all Souls' Day. One of these Masses the 
celebrant may say according to his own intention; one must be offered for all the
faithful departed; and the third for the intention of the Holy Father.
The Church with her usual sublime economy preserved all that was 
innocent, tender and inspired, in the funeral rites of classic antiquity. She 
purified and spiritualized them, handing them on to the new generations of the 
Middle Ages transfigured by a new thought which gave a sense of joy and life to 
the Liturgy of the departed, the thought that they would rise once more like the 
risen Redeemer. Therefore all that was dismal or frightening disappeared. 
There were no more emblems of death, skulls or cross-bones traced upon the 
draperies; all spoke instead of peace and serene hope. The ancient Roman 
cemeteries, then, were not merely graveyards, they were country houses with 
baths and gardens adjoining them, where even the Popes themselves often 
resided.
The memento of the dead in the Mass is common to all Liturgies since the 
Third Century. In Benedictine monasteries, the custom prevailed of 
commemorating every year the benefactors and friends of the house who had 
been taken from this world. St. Odilo, Abbot of Cluny, is generally recognized as
having been responsible for the universal adoption of this custom, already in 
use in many churches.
