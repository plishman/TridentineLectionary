O God, Who dost grant us to draw 
heavenly gifts from the plenitude of the 
Heart of Thy beloved Son: grant, we 
beseech Thee: that imitating the 
exemplary life of Saint Frances Xavier, 
we may ever strive to promote the 
glory of this same Son of Thine and 
attain to the rewards of His kingdom. 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.

<i>(Commemoration of St. Didacus)</i>
We beseech Thee, almighty God, that 
we, who have received heavenly 
nourishment, may through it, by the 
intercession of blessed Didacus, Thy 
Confessor, be defended against all 
adversity. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
