Thou hast held me by my right hand, 
and by Thy will, Thou hast conducted 
me: and with glory hast Thou received 
me. (Ps. 72: 1) How good is God to 
Israel: to them that are of a right heart.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Thou hast 
held me by my right hand, and by Thy 
will, Thou hast conducted me: and with 
glory hast Thou received me.
