Accept, O Lord, the gifts which we offer
to Thee in honor of Saint Frances 
Xavier: and grant that, being made like 
to the Most Sacred Heart of Thy Son, 
we also may be rendered a sacrifice 
pleasing to Thee. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
<br>
<i>(Commemoration of St. Didacus)</i>
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the offering we humbly bring, 
may both be pleasing to Thee for the 
honor of Thy Saints, and cleanse us 
alike in body and soul. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
