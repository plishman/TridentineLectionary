At that time, Jesus spoke and said, I 
praise Thee, Father, Lord of heaven 
and earth, that Thou hast hid these 
things from the wise and prudent, and 
revealed them to little ones. Yea, 
Father, for so it hath seemed good in 
Thy sight. All things have been 
delivered to Me by My Father; and no 
one knows the Son except the Father; 
nor does anyone know the Father 
except the Son, and him to whom the 
Son chooses to reveal Him. Come to 
Me, all you who labor and are 
burdened, and I will give you rest. Take
My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, 
for I am meek and humble of heart; 
and you will find rest for your souls. For
My yoke is easy, and My burden light.
