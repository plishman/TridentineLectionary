O God, Who was pleased that on this 
day the Blessed Virgin, the dwelling- 
place of the Holy Spirit,should be 
presented in the Temple, grant, we 
beseech Thee, that, by her 
intercession, we may deserve to be 
presented in the temple of Thy glory. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the same Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
