O God, who to subject human wisdom 
to divine faith hast made great Thy 
Bishop and Doctor blessed Albert, 
grant us, we beseech Thee, so to 
follow in the path of his teaching as to 
enjoy perfect light in heaven. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
