Mercifully regard this, our sacrifice, O 
Lord, that what we offer up in the 
mystery of the Passion of Thy Son our 
Lord, we may, through the
intercession and example of blessed 
Albert, receive with pious affection. 
Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, our Lord, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
