Through this holy nourishment which 
we have consumed, defend us, O Lord,
from the onslaughts of our enemies, 
and grant that through the prayers of 
blessed Albert, Thy Confessor and 
Bishop, we may be gladdened by 
perpetual peace. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
