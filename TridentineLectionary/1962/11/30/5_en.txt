At that time, Jesus, walking by the sea 
of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon, 
who is called Peter, and Andrew his 
brother, casting a net into the sea (for 
they were fishers). And He saith to 
them, Come ye after Me, and I will 
make you to be fishers of men. And 
they immediately leaving their nets 
followed Him. And going on from 
thence, He saw other two brethren, 
James the son of Zebedee, and John 
his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their
father mending their nets; and he called
them: And they forthwith left their nets 
and father, and followed Him.
