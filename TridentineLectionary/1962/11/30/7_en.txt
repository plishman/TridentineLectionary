May the holy prayer of the blessed 
apostle Andrew commend our sacrifice 
to Thee, O Lord, we beseech, that it 
may be made acceptable by his merits 
in whose honor it is solemnly offered. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
