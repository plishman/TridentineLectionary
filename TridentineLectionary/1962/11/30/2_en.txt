Brethren: With the heart, we believe 
unto justice, but with the mouth, 
confession is made unto salvation. For 
the Scripture saith: Whosoever 
believeth in him, shall not be 
confounded. For there is no distinction
of the Jew and the Greek, for the same
is Lord over all, rich unto all that call 
upon Him. For whosoever shall call 
upon the name of the Lord, shall be 
saved. How then shall they call on Him
in whom they have not believed? Or 
how shall they believe Him of whom 
they have not heard? And how shall 
they hear, without a preacher? And how
shall they preach unless they be sent? 
as it is written: How beautiful are the 
feet of them that preach the gospel of 
peace, of them that bring
glad tidings of good things! But all have
not obeyed the Gospel. For Isaias 
saith: Lord, who hath believed our 
report? Faith, then, cometh by hearing: 
and hearing by the word of Christ. But I
say: Have they not heard? Yea, verily, 
their sound hath
gone into all the earth, and their words
unto the ends of the whole world.
