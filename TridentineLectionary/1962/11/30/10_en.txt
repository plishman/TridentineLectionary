Rejoicing, O Lord, on the feast-day of 
blessed Andrew, we have taken part in 
Thy divine mysteries, and mayest Thou
make them, we beseech Thee, 
redound to our forgiveness as they do 
to the glory of Thy saints. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
