The custom of keeping holy one day in the year as the festival of all God's 
saints, whether commemorated in the Liturgy or not, dates back to at least the 
beginning of the Fifth Century. In ancient times it was usually called the feast of 
All Holy Martyrs. The day of its celebration varied; and in the East, even now, All
Saints is in most places a movable feast.
Pope St. Boniface IV, when dedicating the Roman Pantheon as the Church 
of Our Blessed Lady and All Holy Martyrs, appointed November 1 for the chief 
annual festival in the sacred building. Gregory III built an oratory at St. Peter's 
in honor of all the saints, confessors as well as martyrs, who had died in all 
parts of the world. Gregory IV chose November 1 as the Feast of All Saints.
