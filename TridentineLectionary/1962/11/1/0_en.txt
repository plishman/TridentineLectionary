Let us all rejoice in the Lord, 
celebrating a festival day in honor of all 
the Saints: at whose solemnity the 
Angels rejoice, and give praise to the 
Son of God. (Ps. 32: 1) Rejoice in the 
Lord, ye just: praise becometh the 
upright. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen.
