Almighty and everlasting God, who 
hast granted to honor in one solemn 
Feast the merits of all Thy Saints: we 
beseech Thee, that through the 
multitude of intercessors, Thou wouldst
bestow upon us the desired 
abundance of Thy atonement. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
