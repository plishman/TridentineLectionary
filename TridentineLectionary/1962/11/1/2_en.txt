In those days, behold, I, John, saw 
another Angel ascending from the 
rising of the sun, having the sign of the 
living God. And he cried with a loud 
voice to the four Angels, to whom it was
given to hurt the earth and the sea, 
saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, 
nor the trees, till we sign the servants 
of our God in their foreheads. And I 
heard the number of them that were 
signed: a hundred and forty-four 
thousand were signed out of every tribe
of the children of Israel. Of the tribe of 
Juda were twelve thousand signed: of 
the tribe of Rube twelve thousand 
signed: of the tribe of Gad twelve 
thousand signed: of the tribe of Aser 
twelve thousand signed: of the tribe of 
Nephthali twelve thousand signed: of 
the tribe of Manasses twelve thousand 
signed: of the tribe of Simeon twelve 
thousand signed: of the tribe of Levi 
twelve thousand signed: of the tribe of 
lssachar twelve thousand signed: of the
tribe of Zabulon twelve thousand 
signed: of the tribe of Joseph twelve 
thousand signed: of the tribe of 
Benjamin twelve thousand signed. After
this, I saw a great multitude which no 
man could number, of all nations, and 
tribes, and peoples, and tongues, 
standing before the throne and in sight 
of the Lamb, clothed with white robes, 
and palms in their hands and they cried
with a loud voice, saying: Salvation to 
our God Who sitteth upon the throne, 
and to the Lamb. And all the Angels 
stood round about the throne, and the 
ancients, and the four living creatures; 
and they fell down before the throne 
upon their faces, and adored God, 
saying, Amen. Benediction, and glory, 
and wisdom, and thanksgiving, honor, 
and power, strength to our God for ever
and ever. Amen.
