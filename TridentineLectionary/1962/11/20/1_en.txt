O God, Who didst vouchsafe to call out
of the desert blessed Felix, Thy 
confessor; unto the work of redeeming 
captives, grant, we beseech Thee, that,
being through his intercession 
delivered by Thy grace from the 
captivity of our sins, we may be brought
to our heavenly homeland. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
