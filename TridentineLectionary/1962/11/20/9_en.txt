We beseech Thee, almighty God, that 
we, who have received heavenly 
nourishment, may through it, by the 
intercession of blessed Felix, Thy 
Confessor, be defended against all 
adversity. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
