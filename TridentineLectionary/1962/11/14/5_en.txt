At that time: Jesus said to the 
Pharisees: I am the good shepherd. 
The good shepherd giveth his life for 
his sheep. But the hireling, and he that 
is not the shepherd, whose own the 
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, 
and leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and 
the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the 
sheep: And the hireling flieth, because 
he is a hireling: and he hath no care for
the sheep. I am the good shepherd; 
and I know mine, and mine know me. 
As the Father knoweth me, and I know 
the Father: and I lay down my life for 
my sheep. And other sheep I have, that
are not of this fold: them also I must 
bring, and they shall hear my voice, 
and there shall be one fold and one 
shepherd.
