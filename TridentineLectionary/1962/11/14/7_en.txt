O most mercifuI God, pour Thy 
blessing over these our offerings and 
confirm us in the Faith, which St. 
Josaphat, Thy martyr and bishop, 
upheld by the shedding of his blood. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
