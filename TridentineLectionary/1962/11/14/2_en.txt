Brethren: For every high priest taken 
from among men, is ordained for men 
in the things that appertain to God, that
he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for 
sins: who can have compassion on 
them that are ignorant and that err: 
because he himself also is compassed 
with infirmity. And therefore he ought, 
as for the people, so also for himself, to
offer for sins. Neither doth any man 
take the honour to himself, but he that 
is called by God, as Aaron was. So 
Christ also did not glorify himself, that 
he might be made a high priest: but he 
that said unto him: Thou art my Son, 
this day have I begotten thee. As he 
saith also in another place: Thou art a 
priest for ever, according to the order of
Melchisedech.
