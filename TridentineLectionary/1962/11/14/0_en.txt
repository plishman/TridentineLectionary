Let us all rejoice in the Lord, 
celebrating a festal day in honor of the 
blessed Josaphat the Martyr: at whose 
martyrdom the Angels rejoice, and 
praise the Son of God. -- (Ps. 32. 1). 
Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just: praise 
becometh the upright. V. Glory to the 
Father and to the Son and to the Holy 
Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. -- Let us all rejoice in the 
Lord, celebrating a festal day in honor 
of the blessed Josaphat the Martyr: at 
whose martyrdom the Angels rejoice, 
and praise the Son of God.
