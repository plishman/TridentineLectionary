Stir up in Thy Church, O Lord, the spirit
with which blessed Josaphat, Thy 
martyr and bishop, was filled when he 
laid down his life for us his sheep, so 
that, by his intercession, we, also, may 
be moved and strengthened by the 
same Spirit, and may not fear to lay 
down our lives for our brethren. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the same Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
