May this heavenly table, O Lord,impart 
to us the spirit of fortitude which 
constantly nourished the life of St. 
Josaphat, Thy martyr and bishop, unto 
victory for the honor of the Church. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
