Sanctify, O Lord, the sacrifices 
dedicated to Thee, and, being 
appeased by means thereof, by the 
intercession of blessed Saturninus, Thy
martyr, look favorably upon us. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
