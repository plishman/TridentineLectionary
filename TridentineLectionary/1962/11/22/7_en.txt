May this sacrifice of atonement and 
praise, we beseech Thee, O Lord, by 
the intercession of blessed Cecilia, 
Thy virgin and martyr, ever make us 
worthy of Thy forgiveness. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
