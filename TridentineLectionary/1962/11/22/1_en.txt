O God, Who dost gladden us with the 
annual feast of blessed Cecilia, Thy 
virgin and martyr, grant that, as we 
venerate her in our liturgy, we may also
follow her example in godly living. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
