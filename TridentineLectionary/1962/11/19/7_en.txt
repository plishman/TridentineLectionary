May the offerings of thy holy people be 
accepted by Thee, O Lord, in honor of 
Thy saints, through whose merits they 
know that they have received aid in 
time of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
By the offered gifts we beg Thee, O 
Lord: enlighten kindly Thy Church: so 
that Thy flock everywhere may be 
increasing, and the Shepherds, under 
Thy direction, may be pleasing to Thy 
Name. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
