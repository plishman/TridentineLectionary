Thou hast filled Thy household, O Lord,
with sacred gifts; ever comfort us, we 
beseech Thee, by the intercession of 
the saint whose festival we celebrate. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
O Lord, we beseech Thee, graciously 
govern Thy Church, which Thou hast 
fed with a holy meal; so that, directed 
by a mighty wisdom, she may progress 
in liberty, and persist in the integrity of 
faith. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever
