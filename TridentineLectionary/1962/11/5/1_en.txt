Do thou, O Lord, increase our faith in 
the Resurrection, Thou that workest 
wonders in the relics of Thy saints: and 
make us partakers of that immortal 
glory, a pledge of which we venerate in 
their ashes. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
