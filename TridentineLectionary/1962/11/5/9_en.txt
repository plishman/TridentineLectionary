We implore Thy clemency, O Lord: that 
by the interceding merits of Thy saints 
whose relics we venerate, this sacrifice 
which we offer may be an expiation of 
our sins. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
