Multiply upon us Thy mercy, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, through the 
sacraments which we have received: 
that even as with a pious devotion we 
rejoice in the solemnity of Thy saints 
whose relics we venerate, so also by 
Thy bountiful goodness we may enjoy 
their everlasting fellowship.Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
