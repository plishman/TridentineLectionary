Many are the afflictions of the just, and 
out of these the Lord hath delivered 
them: the Lord keepeth all their bones; 
not one of them shall be broken. ( P.T. 
Alleluia, alleluia.) (Ps. ibid.: 2) I will 
bless the Lord at all times: His praise 
shall be always in my mouth. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Many are 
the afflictions of the just, and out of 
these the Lord hath delivered them: the
Lord keepeth all their bones; not one of
them shall be broken. (P.T. Alleluia, 
alleluia.)
