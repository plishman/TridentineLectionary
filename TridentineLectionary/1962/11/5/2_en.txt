These are men of mercy, whose godly 
deeds have not failed: good things 
continue with their seed, their posterity 
are a holy inheritance, and their seed 
stood in the covenants: and their 
children for their sakes remain forever: 
their seed and their glory shall not be 
forsaken. Their bodies are buried in 
peace, and their name liveth unto 
generation and generation. Let the 
people show forth their wisdom and the
church declare their praise.
