May Thy saints, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, everywhere make us joyful, that, 
while we venerate their merits, we may 
experience their patronage. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(Commemoration of Sts Vitalis & 
Agricola, Martyrs.)Be appeased, O Lord, with the gifts we 
offer, and, by the intercession of Thy 
holy martyrs, Vitalis and Agricola, 
defend us from all dangers. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
