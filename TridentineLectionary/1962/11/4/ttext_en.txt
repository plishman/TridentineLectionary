About fifty years after the Protestant heresy began, Our Lord raised up a 
mere youth to renew the face of His Church. The lifework of St. Charles may be
divided into two periods, first, the activities he discharged beside his uncle Pius 
IV which embraced not only Rome but the Universal Church. Secondly, the 
pastoral office which he filled at Milan, as the Bishop and Apostle of that 
diocese. He may be said to have directed from Rome the last phase of the 
Council of Trent.
The zeal displayed by St. Charles in fulfilling his pastoral duties is almost 
incredible. His field of action as Archbishop of Milan and Legate of the Holy See 
was very extensive. Yet there was no deserted Alpine village which was not 
included in his pastoral visitation. His biographers tell us that in three weeks he 
consecrated no less than fifteen churches. He established a seminary, whose 
rules have been the basis of seminary regulations since that time. He died 
November 4,1584.
Commemoration of Sts. Vitalis & Agricola, Martyrs: St. Vitalis, the servant of 
St. Agricola, by his courage in bearing the most atrocious tortures for the Faith, 
encouraged his master to die bravely with him for Christ. They suffered at 
Bologna in Italy about the year 300.
