Keep safe Thy Church, O, Lord, with 
the continual protection of St. Charles, 
Thy Confessor and Bishop, that, as 
pastoral solicitude rendered him 
glorious, so his intercession may ever 
make us fervent in Thy love. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(Commemoration of Sts Vitalis & 
Agricola, Martyrs.)Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we, who venerate the 
solemnity of Thy holy martyrs, Vitalis 
and Agricola, may be assisted by their 
intercession with Thee. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
