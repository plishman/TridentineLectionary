Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that as we thank You for the 
favors we have received, we may, by 
the intercession of blessed N.,Thy 
Confessor and Bishop, obtain still 
greater blessings. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of Sts Vitalis & 
Agricola, Martyrs.)May this communion, O Lord, purge us 
of guilt and, by the intercession of Thy 
holy martyrs, Vitalls and Agricola, make
us partakers of the heavenly salvation. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
