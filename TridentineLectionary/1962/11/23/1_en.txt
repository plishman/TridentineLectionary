Eternal Shepherd, regard graciously 
Thy flock, and keep it with an 
everlasting protection, by the 
intercession of blessed Clement, Thy 
Martyr and Sovereign Pontiff, whom 
Thou hast constituted shepherd of the 
whole Church. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that, observing the festival of 
blessed Felicitas, Thy Martyr, we may 
be protected by her merits and prayers.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
