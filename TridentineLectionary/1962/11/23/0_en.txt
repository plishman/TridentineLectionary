The Lord saith, My words which I have 
put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of
thy mouth: and thy gifts shall be 
accepted upon My altar. (Ps. 111: 1) 
Blessed is the man that feareth the 
Lord; he delighteth exceedingly in His 
commandments. V. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. The Lord saith, My words 
which I have put in thy mouth, shall not 
depart out of thy mouth: and thy gifts 
shall be accepted upon My altar.
