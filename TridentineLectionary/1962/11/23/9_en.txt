O Lord, we beseech Thee, graciously 
govern Thy Church, which Thou hast 
fed with a holy meal; so that, directed 
by a mighty wisdom, she may progress 
in liberty, and persist in the integrity of 
faith. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
Humbly we pray Thee, O almighty 
God, that, by the intercession of Thy 
saints, Thou both multiply Thy gifts in 
us and dispose our lives according to 
Thy wisdom. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
