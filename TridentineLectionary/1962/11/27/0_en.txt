It shall be as a sign in thy hand, and as 
a memorial before thine eyes, and that 
the law of the Lord be always in thy 
mouth. Ps. 104: 1. O give thanks unto 
the Lord, and call upon His name: tell 
forth His deeds among the nations. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. It shall be 
as a sign in thy hand, and as a 
memorial before thine eyes, and that 
the law of the Lord be always in thy 
mouth.
