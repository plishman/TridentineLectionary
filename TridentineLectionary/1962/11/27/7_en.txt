Moved by the pleading of the blessed 
Virgin Mary, in answer to whose 
prayers Jesus Christ Thy Son wrought 
the first of His miracles: vouchsafe unto
us, O Lord God. to minister in 
cleanness of heart unto the sacrament 
of the body and blood of the same Thy
Son, so as to deserve to sit down to the
everlasting banquet of eternity. 
Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, our Lord, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
