At that time there was a marriage in 
Cana of Galilee: and the mother of 
Jesus was there. And Jesus also was 
invited, and His disciples, to the 
marriage. And the wine failing, the 
mother of Jesus saith to Him: They 
have no wine. And Jesus saith to her: 
Woman, what is that to Me and to 
thee? My hour is not yet come. His 
mother saith to the waiters: 
Whatsoever He shall say to you, do ye.
Now there were set there six water 
pots of stone, according to the manner 
of the purifying of the Jews, containing 
two or three measures apiece. Jesus 
saith to them: Fill the
water-pots with water. And they filled 
them up to the brim. And Jesus saith to 
them: Draw out now, and carry to the 
chief steward of the feast. And
they carried it. And when the chief 
steward had tasted the water made 
wine, and knew not whence it was, but
the waiters knew who had drawn the 
water: the chief steward calls the 
bridegroom, and saith to him: Every 
man at first sets forth good wine: and 
when men have well drunk, then that 
which is worse: but thou hast kept the 
good wine until now. This beginning of 
miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee; 
and manifested His glory, and His 
disciples believed in Him.
