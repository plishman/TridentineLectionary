O Lord Jesus Christ, Who hast willed 
that the most blessed Virgin Mary, Thy
mother, sinless from the first moment of
her conception, should be glorified by 
countless miracles: grant that we, who 
never cease from imploring her 
patronage, may attain in the end to 
eternal happiness. Who lives and 
reigns with God the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
