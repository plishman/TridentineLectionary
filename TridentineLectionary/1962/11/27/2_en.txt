A great sign appeared in heaven: a 
woman clothed with the sun, and the 
moon under her feet, and on her head 
a crown of twelve stars. And she 
brought forth a Man-Child, Who was to 
rule all nations with an iron rod: and 
her Son was taken up to God, and to 
His throne. And there were given to the 
woman two wings of a great eagle, that
she might fiy into the desert unto her 
place. And the serpent cast out of his 
mouth after the woman, water as it 
were a river: that he might cause her to
be carried away by the river. And the 
earth helped the woman, and the earth
opened her mouth, and swallowed up 
the river, which the dragon cast out of 
his mouth.
