O God, Who didst give the law to 
Moses on the summit of Mount Sinai 
and by means of Thy holy angels didst 
miraculously place there the body of 
blessed Catherine, Thy Virgin and 
Martyr: grant we beseech Thee, that, 
by her merits and intercession, we may
be able to come unto the mountain 
which is Christ: Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
