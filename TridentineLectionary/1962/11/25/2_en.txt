I will give glory to Thee, O Lord, O 
King, and I will praise Thee, O God my 
Savior. I will give glory to Thy Name, for
Thou hast been a helper and protector 
to me, and hast preserved my body 
from destruction, from the snare of an 
unjust tongue, and from the lips of them
that forge lies; and in the sight of them 
that stood by Thou hast been my 
helper. And Thou hast delivered me, 
according to the multitude of the mercy 
of Thy Name, from them that did roar, 
prepared to devour; out of the hands of 
them that sought my life, and from the 
gates of afflictions which compassed 
me about: from the oppression of the 
flame which surrounded me, and in the 
midst of the fire I was not burnt: from 
the depth of the body of hell, and from 
an unclean tongue, and from lying 
words, from an unjust king, and from a 
slanderous tongue. My soul shall praise
the Lord even unto death: because 
Thou, O Lord our God, deliverest them 
that wait for Thee, and savest them out 
of the hands of the nations.
