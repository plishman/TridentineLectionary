At that time, Jesus entering in, walked 
through Jericho. And behold there was 
a man named Zachæus, who was the 
chief of the publicans, and he was rich; 
and he sought to see Jesus Who He 
was, and he could not for the crowd, 
because he was of low stature. And 
running before, he climbed up into a 
sycamore-tree that he might see Him, 
for He was to pass that way. And when 
Jesus was come to the place, looking 
up, He saw him, and said to him, 
Zachæus, make haste and come down,
for this day I must abide in thy house. 
And he made haste and came down, 
and received Him with joy. And when all
saw it, they murmured, saying that He 
was gone to be a guest with a man that
was a sinner. But Zachæus standing, 
said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half 
of my goods I give to the poor, and if I 
have wronged any man of anything, I 
restore him fourfold. Jesus said to him, 
This day is salvation come to this 
house; because he also is a son of 
Abraham. For the Son of man is come 
to seek and to save that which was 
lost.
