Bow down to our prayers, O Lord, we 
beseech Thee that, while we pay our 
vows here below, we may, by Thine 
assistance, be worthy to attain unto 
everlasting rewards. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Theodore, 
Martyr.)Receive, O Lord, the prayers of the 
faithful with offerings of sacrifices, and, 
by the intercession of blessed 
Theodore, Thy martyr, may we pass 
through these offices of pious devotion 
to heavenly glory. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
