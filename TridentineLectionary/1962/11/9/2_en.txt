In those days, I saw the holy city, the 
new Jerusalem, coming down out of 
Heaven,from God, prepared as a bride 
adorned for her husband. And I heard a
great voice from the throne, saying, 
Behold the tabernacle of God with men;
and He will dwell with them: and they 
shall be His people, and God Himself 
with them shall be their God: and God 
shall wipe away all tears from their 
eyes; and death shall be no more, nor 
mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall 
be any more, for the former things are 
passed away. And He that sat on the 
throne said, Behold, I make all things 
new.
