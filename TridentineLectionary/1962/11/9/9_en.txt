O God, Who from living and chosen 
stones dost prepare for Thy majesty an
eternal dwelling, help Thy people who 
call upon Thee, so that what is 
profitable to Thy Church in material 
growth may be accompanied with an 
increase of that which is of the spirit. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Theodore, 
Martyr.)Grant us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, by
the intercession of blessed Theodore, 
Thy martyr, that what we touch with our
lips we may receive with pure hearts. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
