As the anniversary of the dedication of a cathedral is kept as a solemn 
festival in all the churches of a diocese, so the dedication of the Church of St. 
John Lateran, the cathedral of the Supreme Pontiff, is everywhere celebrated. 
Since the time of Constantine the Lateran became the ordinary residence of the 
Popes, and may be regarded as a memorial of that long series of holy Pontiffs 
who inhabited it during the course of nearly ten centuries.
The walls of the Lateran, now nearly two thousand years old, have seen 
many important events in history and have figured in poetry and in art, while 
they sheltered a dynasty of Pontiffs who ruled longer than any dynasty of kings. 
Within them, at the suggestion of Pope Sylvester, Constantine the Great 
transformed or constructed the first basilica dedicated to the Savior at Rome. In 
the Twelfth Century, on account of the baptistery, it was dedicated to St. John 
the Baptist and began to be called St. John Lateran.
The basilica, after its destruction, was rebuilt by Benedict XIII and 
consecrated on November 9,1726. Since that time the feast has been kept in 
the Universal Church.
Commemoration of St. Theodore, Martyr: St. Theodore was a soldier martyr,
and suffered death at Amasea in Asia Minor in 306. After being tortured by 
having his flesh torn by iron hooks, he was burned. During his martyrdom he 
sang the verse of the Psalm: "I will bless the Lord at all times."
