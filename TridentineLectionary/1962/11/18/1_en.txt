God, Who year by year dost renew the 
day of the consecration of this Thy holy
temple, and dost ever bring us again in 
safety to the holy mysteries,hear the 
prayers of Thy people, and grant that 
whosoever entereth this temple to seek
blessings may rejoice to obtain all that 
he seeketh. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
