Terrible is this place: it is the house of 
God, and the gate of heaven; and shall 
be called the court of God. (Ps. 83: 2, 
3) How lovely are Thy tabernacles, O 
Lord of hosts! my soul longeth and 
fainteth for the courts of the Lord. v. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Terrible is 
this place: it is the house of God, and 
the gate of heaven; and shall be called 
the court of God.
