O most merciful God, Who, when the 
holy abbot Sylvester was piously 
pondering over the vanity of earthly 
things whilst he stood by an open 
grave, didst vouchsafe to call him to the
desert, we supplicate Thee that, 
despising earthly things, after his 
example, we may forever enjoy Thy 
presence. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Look upon our infirmity, O almighty 
God, and, because the weight of our 
own evil deeds beareth us down, may 
the glorious intercession of blessed 
Peter, Thy martyr and bishop, protect 
us. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
