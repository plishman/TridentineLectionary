We beseech Thee, O Lord, that, while 
we reverently offer these gifts to Thy 
divine majesty we may by pious 
preparation of soul and purity of heart, 
following the example of blessed abbot 
Sylvester, become worthy to partake of 
the body and blood of Thy Son. Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
Graciously receive, O Lord, the 
sacrifices dedicated to the merits of 
Thy blessed martyr and bishop, Peter, 
and grant they may be for us an 
everlasting help. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
