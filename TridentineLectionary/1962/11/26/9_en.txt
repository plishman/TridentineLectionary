We pray Thee, O Lord, that Thou grant
unto us, refreshed with the divine 
banquet, to follow closely the footsteps
of the holy abbot Sylvester, that we 
may have an abundant reward with the
saints in the kingdom of Thy glory. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
Refreshed by participation in the 
sacred gift, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
our God, that, through the intercession 
of blessed Peter, Thy martyr and 
bishop, we may ever experience the 
effect of the worship we offer. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
