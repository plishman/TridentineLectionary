Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we, who have known the 
fortitude of the glorious martyrs in 
bearing witness to Thee, may 
experience the fruit of their intercession
with Thee. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
