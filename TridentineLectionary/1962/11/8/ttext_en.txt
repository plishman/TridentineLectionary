In the persecution under Diocletian, Sts. Severus, Severianus, 
Carpophorus, and Victorinus, four brothers, were cruelly tortured until they 
expired in the hands of their tormentors. They were at first known simply as four 
Christians who had won the crown of martyrdom and continued to be so styled 
even after their names were learned.
