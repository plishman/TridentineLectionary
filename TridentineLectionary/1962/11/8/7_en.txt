May Thy plenteous blessing descend 
upon us, O Lord, both to render our 
gifts acceptable to Thee, by the 
intercession of Thy holy martyrs, and to
effect the sacrament of our redemption.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
