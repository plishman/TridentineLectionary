Brethren, the saints through faith 
subdued kingdoms, wrought justice, 
obtained promises, stopped the mouths
of lions, quenched the violence of fire, 
escaped the edge of the sword, 
recovered strength from weakness, 
became valiant in battle, put to flight 
the armies of foreigners: women 
received their dead raised to life again: 
but others were racked, not accepting 
deliverance, that they might find a 
better resurrection; and others had trial 
of mockeries, and stripes, moreover 
also of bands and prisons: they were 
stoned, they were cut asunder, they 
were tempted, they were put to death 
by the sword, they wandered about in 
sheepskins, in goat-skins, being in 
want, distressed, afflicted, of whom the 
world was not worthy; wandering in 
deserts, in mountains and in dens, and 
in caves of the earth. And all these 
were found approved by the testimony 
of faith, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
