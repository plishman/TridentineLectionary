O God, Who on this day didst teach the
hearts of Thy faithful by the light of the 
Holy Spirit: grant unto us, by the same 
Spirit, to be wise in what is right, and 
ever to rejoice in His consolation. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the same Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
