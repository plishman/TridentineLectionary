The Spirit of the Lord hath filled the 
whole world, alleluia; and that which 
containeth all things hath knowledge of 
the voice, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps.
67: 2) Let God arise, and let His 
enemies be scattered: and let them that
hate Him flee from before His face. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. The Spirit of
the Lord hath filled the whole world, 
alleluia; and that which containeth all 
things hath knowledge of the voice, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
