At that time Jesus said to His disciples, 
If any one love Me, he will keep My 
word, and My Father will love him, and 
We will come to him and will make Our 
abode in him: he that loveth Me not, 
keepeth not My words. And the word 
which you have heard is not Mine: but 
the Father's Who sent Me. These 
things have I spoken to you, abiding 
with you. But the Paraclete, the Holy 
Spirit, Whom the Father will send in My
Name, He will teach you all things, and 
bring all things to your mind, 
whatsoever I shall have said to you. 
Peace I leave with you, My peace I give
unto you: not as the world giveth, do I 
give unto you. Let not your heart be 
troubled, nor let it be afraid. You have 
heard that I said to you: I go away, and 
I come unto you. If you loved Me, you 
would indeed be glad, because I go to 
the Father: for the Father is greater 
than I. And now I have told you before it
come to pass: that when it shall come 
to pass you may believe. I will not now 
speak many things with you. For the 
prince of this world cometh, and in Me 
he hath not any thing. But that the 
world may know that I love the Father, 
and as the Father hath given Me 
commandment, so do I.
