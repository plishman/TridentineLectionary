When the days of the Pentecost were 
accomplished, they were all together in 
one place; and suddenly there came a 
sound from heaven, as of a mighty 
wind coming, and it filled the whole 
house where they were sitting. And 
there appeared to them parted tongues
as it were of fire, and it sat upon every 
one of them; and they were all filled 
with the Holy Spirit, and they began to 
speak with divers tongues, according 
as the Holy Spirit gave them to speak. 
Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem 
Jews, devout men, out of every nation 
under heaven, And when this was 
noised abroad, the multitude came 
together, and were confounded in 
mind, because that every man heard 
them speak in his own tongue. And 
they were all amazed, and wondered, 
saying: Behold, are not all these that 
speak Galileans? And how have we 
heard every one of our own tongues 
wherein we were born? Parthians and 
Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants 
of Mesopotamia, Judea and 
Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia,
and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of 
Lybia about Cyrene, and strangers of 
Rome, Jews also, and Proselytes, 
Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard 
them speak in our own tongues the 
wonderful works of God.
