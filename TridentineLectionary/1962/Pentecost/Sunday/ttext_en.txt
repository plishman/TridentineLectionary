Peter is the leader around whom gathers the little flock of Sion on this first 
Christian Pentecost, and he inaugurates today his pontifical primacy when he 
announces for the first time the Gospel message to the representatives of the 
various nations, without distinction of race or nationality, of country or state.
On this day Christ, risen from the grave and seated at the right hand of the 
Father, communicates His own divine life to the members of His Mystical Body 
through the outpouring of the Holy Ghost. So the Church having attained its full 
development, now first appears before the world.
To appreciate the Introit it should be heard with the majestic and joyful 
melody which the ancient Gregorian music has allotted to it.
The Sequence, Veni, Sancte Spiritus, attributed to Innocent IIl, replaced 
under Pius V an older one of great beauty. This Sequence is repeated daily 
throughout the octave. The Holy Ghost descends in power to vindicate the 
innocence of Jesus by filling the Church with such surpassing sanctity that it 
becomes, as it were, a fire prefiguring the final judgment on the enemies of 
God. The faithful kneel at the invocation of the Holy Spirit, Who at the last day 
requires the restoration of the Christian soul to the body which has been His 
mystical temple.
