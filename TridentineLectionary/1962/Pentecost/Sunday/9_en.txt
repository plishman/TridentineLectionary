Communicating with, and keeping the 
most holy day of Pentecost, whereon 
the Holy Spirit appeared to the Apostles
in countless tongues and also 
reverencing the memory, first, of the 
glorious Mary, ever Virgin, Mother of 
our God and Lord Jesus Christ: as also
of blessed Joseph, Spouse of the 
Virgin, of the blessed Apostles and 
Martyrs Peter and Paul, Andrew, 
James, John, Thomas, James, Philip, 
Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon and 
Thaddeus: Linus, Cletus, Clement, 
Sixtus, Cornelius, Cyprian, Lawrence, 
Chrysogonus, John and Paul, Cosmas 
and Damian, and of all Thy Saints, 
through whose merits and prayers 
grant that we may in all things be 
defended by the help of Thy protection.
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
