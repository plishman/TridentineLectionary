We therefore beseech Thee, O Lord, 
graciously to accept this oblation of our 
service, as also of Thy whole family, 
which we make unto Thee on behalf of 
these whom Thou hast vouchsafed to 
bring to a new birth by water and the 
Holy Spirit, granting them remission of 
all their sins: and to dispose our days in
Thy peace, preserve us from eternal 
damnation and rank us in the number 
of Thine elect. Through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
