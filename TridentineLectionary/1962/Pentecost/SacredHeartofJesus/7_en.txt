Have regard, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, to the inexpressible love of the 
Heart of Thy beloved Son: so that what 
we offer may be a gift acceptable to 
Thee, and an expiation for our 
offenses. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
