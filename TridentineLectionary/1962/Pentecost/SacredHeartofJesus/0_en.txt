The thoughts of His Heart are from
generation to generation: to save their
souls from death, and to feed them in
famine. Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just: 
praise becometh the upright. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. The 
thoughts of His Heart are from
generation to generation: to save their
souls from death, and to feed them in
famine.
