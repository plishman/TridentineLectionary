O God, who in the Heart of Thy Son,
wounded by our sins, dost mercifully
vouchsafe to bestow upon us the 
boundless treasures of Thy love: grant, 
we beseech Thee, that we who now 
render Him the service of our devotion 
and piety, may also fulfill our duty of 
worthy satisfaction. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
