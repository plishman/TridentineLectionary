At that time: The Jews (because it was 
the Parasceve), that the bodies might 
not remain upon the cross on the 
Sabbath day (for that was a great 
Sabbath day) besought Pilate that their 
legs might be broken, and that they 
might be taken away. The soldiers 
therefore came: and they broke the 
legs of the first, and of the other that 
was crucified with Him. But after they 
were come to Jesus, when they saw 
that He was already dead they did not 
break His legs. But one of the soldiers 
with a spear opened His side, and 
immediately there came out blood and 
water. And he that saw it hath given 
testimony: and his testimony is true. 
And he knoweth that he saith true, that 
you may believe. For these things were
done that the Scripture might be 
fulfilled: You shall not break a bone of 
Him. And again another Scripture saith:
They shall look on Him whom they 
pierced.
