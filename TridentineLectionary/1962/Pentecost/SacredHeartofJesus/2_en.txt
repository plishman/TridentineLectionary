Brethren, To me, the least of all the
Saints, is given this grace, to preach 
among the Gentiles the unsearchable 
riches of Christ: and to enlighten all 
men, that they may see what is the 
dispensation of the mystery which hath
been hidden from eternity in God, who 
created all things: that the manifold 
wisdom of God may be made known to 
the principalities and powers in 
heavenly places through the Church, 
according to the eternal purpose which 
He made in Christ Jesus our Lord: in 
whom we have boldness and access 
with confidence by the faith of Him. For 
this cause I bow my knees to the 
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of 
whom all paternity in heaven and earth 
is named, that He would grant you 
according to the riches of His glory, to 
be strengthened by His Spirit with 
might unto the inward man, that Christ 
may dwell by faith in your hearts: that, 
being rooted and grounded in charity, 
you may be able to comprehend with 
all the Saints, what is the breadth and
length, and height and depth: to know 
also the charity of Christ which 
surpasseth all knowledge, that you 
may be filled unto all the fullness of 
God.
