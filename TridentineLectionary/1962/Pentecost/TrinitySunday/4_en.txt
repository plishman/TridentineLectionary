At that time Jesus said to His disciples,
All power is given to Me in heaven and 
on earth. Go therefore , teach ye all 
nations, baptizing them in the name of 
the Father and of the Son and of the 
Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe 
all things whatsoever I have 
commanded you. And behold I am with
you all days, even to the consummation
of the world.
