O almighty and everlasting God, who 
hast granted to Thy servants, in 
confessing the true Faith, to 
acknowledge the glory of the eternal 
Trinity, and in the power of Majesty to 
adore the Unity: we beseech Thee, that
by steadfastness in the same Faith, we 
may ever be defended against all 
adversity. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
