O Lord, our God, may the receiving of 
this Sacrament and the acknowledging
of the holy and eternal Trinity and its 
undivided Unity profit us unto health of 
mind and body. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God forever and ever.
