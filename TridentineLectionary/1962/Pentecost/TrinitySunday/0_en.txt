Blessed be the Holy Trinity and 
undivided Unity: we will give glory to 
Him, because He hath shown His 
mercy to us. (Ps. 8: 2) O Lord, our 
Lord, how wonderful is Thy Name in all 
the earth! Glory be to the Father and 
to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Blessed be the Holy Trinity and 
undivided Unity: we will give glory to 
Him, because He hath shown His 
mercy to us.
