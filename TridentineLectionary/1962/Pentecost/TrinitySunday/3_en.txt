Blessed art Thou, O Lord, that 
beholdest the depths and sittest above 
the Cherubim. Blessed art Thou, O 
Lord, in the firmament of heaven, and 
worthy of praise for ever. Alleluia, 
alleluia. (Dan. 3: 52) Blessed art 
Thou, O Lord, the God of our fathers, 
and worthy to be praised forever. 
Alleluia.
