O the depths of the riches of the 
wisdom and of the knowledge of God! 
How incomprehensible are His 
judgments, and how unsearchable His 
ways! For who hath known the mind of
the Lord? Or who hath been His 
counselor? Or who hath first given to 
Him, and recompense shall be made 
him? For of Him, and by Him, and in 
Him, are all things: to Him be glory for 
ever. Amen.
