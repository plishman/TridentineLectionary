At that time, Jesus said to His disciples 
this parable: There was a certain man, 
who had a steward; and the same was 
accused unto him that he had wasted 
his goods; and he called him, and said 
to him: How is it that I hear this of thee?
Give an account of thy stewardship, for 
now thou canst be steward no longer, 
And the steward said within himself: 
What shall I do, because my lord takes 
away from me the stewardship? To dig 
I am not able; to beg I am ashamed. I 
know what I will do, that when I shall be
put out of the stewardship, they may 
receive me into their houses, Therefore
calling together every one of his lord's 
debtors, he said to the first: How much 
dost thou owe my lord? But he said: A 
hundred barrels of oil. And he said to 
him: Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, 
and write fifty. Then he said to another: 
And how much dost thou owe my lord? 
Who said: A hundred quarters of wheat.
He said to him: Take thy bill, and write 
eighty. And the lord commended the 
unjust steward, as much as he had 
done wisely: for the children of this 
world are wiser in their generation than 
the children of light. And I say to you: 
Make unto you friends of the mammon 
of iniquity, that when you shall fail, they 
may receive you into everlasting 
dwellings.
