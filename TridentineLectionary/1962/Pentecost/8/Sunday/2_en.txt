Brethren, We are debtors, not to the 
flesh, to live according to the flesh; for if
you live according to the flesh, you 
shall die but if by the Spirit you mortify 
the deeds of the flesh, you shall live. 
For whoever are led by the Spirit of 
God, they are the sons of God. For you
have not received the spirit of bondage 
again in fear, but you have received the
spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we 
cry, Abba (Father). For the Spirit 
Himself gives testimony to our spirit, 
that we are the sons of God and if 
sons, heirs also, heirs indeed of God, 
and joint heirs with Christ.
