Accept, we beseech Thee, 0 Lord, the 
gifts of Thine own bounty, which we 
bring Thee: that these holy and sacred 
Mysteries, by the working of the power 
of Thy grace, may sanctify us in our 
conduct of this present life and bring us
to everlasting joys. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
