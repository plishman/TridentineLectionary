Bestow upon us, O Lord, we beseech 
Thee, the spirit to think and do always 
such things as are right; that we who 
cannot exist without Thee, may be able
to live according to Thy will. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
