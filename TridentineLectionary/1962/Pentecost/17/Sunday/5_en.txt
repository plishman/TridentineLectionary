At that time the Pharisees came to 
Jesus, and one of them, a doctor of the
law, asked Him, tempting Him: Master, 
which is the great commandment of the
law? Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, 
and with thy whole soul, and with thy 
whole mind. This is the greatest and 
the first commandment. And the 
second is like to this: Thou shalt love 
thy neighbor as thyself. On these two 
commandments depends the whole 
law and the prophets: And the 
Pharisees being gathered together, 
Jesus asked them, saying: What think 
you of Christ, whose son is He? They 
say to Him: David's. He saith to them: 
How then doth David, in spirit, call Him 
Lord, saying: The Lord said to My Lord:
Sit on my right hand until I make Thine 
enemies Thy footstool? If David then 
call Him Lord, how is He his son? And 
no man was able to answer Him a 
word; neither durst any man, from that 
day forth, ask Him any more questions.
