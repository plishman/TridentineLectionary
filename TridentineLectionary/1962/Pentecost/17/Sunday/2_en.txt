Brethren, I, a prisoner of the Lord, 
beseech you that you walk worthy of 
the vocation in which you are called. 
With all humility and mildness, with 
patience, supporting one another in 
charity, careful to keep the unity of the 
Spirit in the bond of peace. One body 
and one spirit, as you are called in one 
hope of your calling, One Lord, one 
faith, one baptism. One God and 
Father of all, Who is above all, and 
through all, and in us all, who is 
blessed for ever and ever. Amen.
