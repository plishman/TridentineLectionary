Thou art just, O Lord, and Thy 
judgment is right: deal with Thy servant
according to Thy mercy. (Ps. 118: 1) 
Blessed are the undefiled in the way: 
who walk in the law of the Lord. Glory 
be to the Father and to the Son and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Thou art 
just, O Lord, and Thy judgment is right: 
deal with Thy servant according to Thy 
mercy.
