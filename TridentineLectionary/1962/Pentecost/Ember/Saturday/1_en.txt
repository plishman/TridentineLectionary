Almighty and everlasting God, Who by
means of healthful abstinence dost 
heal both minds and bodies, very 
humbly we entreat Thy Majesty: be 
appeased by the devout prayer of 
those who fast, and give us help both 
now and for time to come. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
