Brethren: There was a tabernacle 
made the first, wherein were the 
candlesticks, and the table, and the 
setting forth of loaves, which is called 
the holy. And after the second veil, the 
tabernacle, which is called the holy of 
holies: Having a golden censer, and 
the ark of the testament covered about 
on every part with gold, in which was a 
golden pot that had manna, and the 
rod of Aaron, that had blossomed, and 
the tables of the testament. And over it 
were the cherubims of glory 
overshadowing the propitiatory: of 
which it is not needful to speak now 
particularly. Now these things being 
thus ordered, into the first tabernacle 
the priests indeed always entered, 
accomplishing the offices of sacrifices. 
But into the second, the high priest 
alone, once a year: not without blood, 
which he offereth for his own, and the 
people's ignorance: The Holy Ghost 
signifying this, that the way into the 
holies was not yet made manifest, 
whilst the former tabernacle was yet 
standing. Which is a parable of the 
time present: according to which gifts 
and sacrifices are offered, which can 
not, as to the conscience, make him 
perfect that serveth, only in meats and 
in drinks, And divers washings, and 
justices of the flesh laid on them until 
the time of correction. But Christ, being
come an high priest of the good things 
to come, by a greater and more perfect
tabernacle not made with hand, that is,
not of this creation: Neither by the 
blood of goats, or of calves, but by his 
own blood, entered once into the 
holies, having obtained eternal 
redemption.
