In those days, the Lord spoke to 
Moses, saying: From the fifteenth day 
of the seventh month, when you shall 
have gathered in all the fruits of your 
land, you shall celebrate the feast of 
the Lord seven days: on the first day 
and the eighth shall be a sabbath, that 
is a day of rest. And you shall take to 
you on the first day the fruits of the 
fairest tree, and branches of palm 
trees, and boughs of thick trees, and 
willows of the brook, and you shall 
rejoice before the Lord your God. And 
you shall keep the solemnity thereof 
seven days in the year. It shall be an 
everlasting ordinance in your 
generations. In the seventh month 
shall you celebrate this feast. And you 
shall dwell in bowers seven days: 
every one that is of the race of Israel, 
shall dwell in tabernacles: That your 
posterity may know, that I made the 
children of Israel to dwell in 
tabernacles, when I brought them out 
of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your
God.
