At the time, Jesus spoke to the 
multitude this parable: A certain man 
had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, 
and he came seeking fruit on it, and 
found none. And he said to the dresser
of the vineyard: Behold, for these three
years I come seeking fruit on this fig 
tree, and I find none. Cut it down 
therefore: why cumbereth it the 
ground? But he answering, said to 
him: Lord, let it alone this year also, 
until I dig about it, and dung it. And if 
happily it bear fruit: but if not, then 
after that thou shalt cut it down. And 
He was teaching in their synagogue on
their sabbath. And behold there was a 
woman, who had a spirit of infirmity 
eighteen years: and she was bowed 
together, neither could she look 
upwards at all. Whom when Jesus 
saw, He called her unto him, and said 
to her: Woman, thou art delivered 
from thy infirmity. And He laid his 
hands upon her, and immediately she 
was made straight, and glorified God. 
And the ruler of the synagogue (being 
angry that Jesus had healed on the 
sabbath) answering, said to the 
multitude: Six days there are wherein 
you ought to work. In them therefore 
come, and be healed; and not on the 
sabbath day. And the Lord answering 
him, said: Ye hypocrites, doth not 
every one of you, on the sabbath day, 
loose his ox or his ass from the 
manger, and lead them to water? And 
ought not this daughter of Abraham, 
whom Satan hath bound, lo, these 
eighteen years, be loosed from this 
bond on the sabbath day? And when 
he said these things, all his 
adversaries were ashamed: and all the
people rejoiced for all the things that 
were gloriously done by Him.
