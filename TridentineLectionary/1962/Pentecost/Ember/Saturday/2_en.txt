In those days, the Lord spoke to 
Moses, saying: Upon the tenth day of 
this seventh month shall be the day of 
atonement, it shall be most solemn, 
and shall be called holy: and you shall 
afflict your souls on that day, and shall 
offer a holocaust to the Lord. You shall 
do no servile work in the time of this 
day: because it is a day of propitiation, 
that the Lord your God may be 
merciful unto you. Every soul that is 
not afflicted on this day, shall perish 
from among his people: And every soul
that shall do any work, the same will I 
destroy from among his people. You 
shall do no work therefore on that day: 
it shall be an everlasting ordinance 
unto you in all your generations, and 
dwellings. It is a sabbath of rest, and 
you shall afflict your souls beginning 
on the ninth day of the month:from 
evening until evening you shall 
celebrate your sabbaths: saith the Lord
almighty.
