Come, let us adore God, and fall down
before the Lord: let us weep before 
Him Who made us; for He is the Lord 
our God. (Ps. 94: 1) Come, let us 
praise the Lord with joy; let us joyfully 
sing to God our Savior. Glory be to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Come, let us adore God, 
and fall down before the Lord: let us 
weep before Him Who made us; for He 
is the Lord our God.
<br>
Let us pray.
Let us kneel.
R. Arise.
