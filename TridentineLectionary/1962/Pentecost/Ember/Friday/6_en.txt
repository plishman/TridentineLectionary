May the gift of our fasting, we beseech
You, O Lord, be acceptable to You, 
and by its purifying power make us 
worthy of Your grace and bring us to 
the eternal bliss You have promised 
us. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
