The Station on Ember Friday is regularly at the Church of the Twelve Holy 
Apostles in Rome. This arose from the founding of this Church at the same time 
when the Friday Liturgy became common. An ancient Roman custom of fasting 
strictly three days in the week was relaxed somewhat under Pope Callixtus and 
limited to the three periods of the harvest, the vintage, and the drawing off of the
new wine.
The Introit bids us seek the Lord; the search after God is in the ancient rule 
of St. Benedict the one condition by which the vocation of aspirants to the 
religious life is to be judged. In the prayer we ask that to bodily abstinence we 
may add mental observances. The Postcommunion of today is used in many 
feasts of saints; we ask for greater benefits which can be none other than the 
grace of union with Jesus in heaven.
