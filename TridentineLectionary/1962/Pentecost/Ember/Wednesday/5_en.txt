In those days all the people were 
gathered together as one man, to the 
street which is before the water gate, 
and they spoke to Esdras the scribe, to 
bring the book of the law of Moses, 
which the Lord had commanded to 
Israel. Then Esdras the priest brought 
the law before the multitude of men and
women, and all those that could 
understand, on the first day of the 
seventh month. And he read it plainly in
the street that was before the water 
gate, from the morning until mid-day, 
before the men and women, and all 
those that could understand; and the 
ears of all the people were attentive to 
the book. And Esdras the scribe stood 
upon a step of wood, which he made to
speak upon. And he opened the book 
before all the people, for he was above 
all the people; and when he had 
opened it, all the people stood. And 
Esdras blessed the Lord the great God,
and all the people answered: Amen, 
Amen, lifting up their hands: and they 
bowed down, and adored God, with 
their faces to the ground. Now the 
Levites mad silence among the people 
to hear the law; and the people stood in
their place: and they read in the book of
the law of God distinctly and plainly to 
be understood; and they understood 
when it was read. And Nehemias, and 
Esdras the priest and scribe, and the 
levites who interpreted to all the people
said: This is a holy day to the Lord our 
God; do not mourn nor weep. And he 
said to them. Go eat fat meats and 
drink sweet wines, and send portions to
them that have no prepared for 
themselves; because it is the holy day 
of the Lord, and be not sad, for the joy 
of the Lord is our strength.
