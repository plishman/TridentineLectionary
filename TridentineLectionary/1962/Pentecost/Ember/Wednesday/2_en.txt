Thus saith the Lord God: Behold the 
days come, when the ploughman shall 
overtake the reaper, and the treader of 
grapes him that soweth seeds, and the 
mountains shall drop sweetness, and 
every hill shall be tilled. And I will bring 
back the captivity of My people Israel, 
and they shall build the abandoned 
cities, and inhabit them; and they shall 
plant vineyards, and drink the wine of 
them; and shall make gardens, and eat 
the fruits of them: and I will plant them 
upon their own land: and I will no more 
pluck them out of the their land which I 
have given them; saith the Lord thy 
God.
