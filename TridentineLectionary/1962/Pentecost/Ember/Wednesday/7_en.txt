At the time, one of the multitude 
answering said to Jesus: Master, I have
brought my son to thee, having a dumb
spirit. Who, wheresoever he taketh him,
dasheth him, and he foameth, and 
gnasheth with the teeth, and pineth 
away; and I spoke to thy disciples to 
cast him out, and they could not. Who 
answering them, said: O incredulous 
generation, how long shall I be with 
you? how long shall I suffer you? bring 
him unto me. And they brought him. 
And when he had seen him, 
immediately the spirit troubled him; and
being thrown down upon the ground, 
he rolled about foaming. And he asked 
his father: How long time is it since this 
hath happened unto him? But he said: 
From his infancy: And oftentimes hath 
he cast him into the fire and into waters
to destroy him. But if thou canst do any 
thing, help us, having compassion on 
us. And Jesus saith to him: If thou 
canst believe, all things are possible to 
him that believeth. And immediately the
father of the boy crying out, with tears 
said: I do believe, Lord: help my 
unbelief. And when Jesus saw the 
multitude running together, he 
threatened the unclean spirit, saying to 
him: Deaf and dumb spirit, I command 
thee, go out of him; and enter not any 
more into him. And crying out, and 
greatly tearing him, he went out of him, 
and he became as dead, so that many 
said: He is dead. But Jesus taking him 
by the hand, lifted him up; and he 
arose. And when he was come into the 
house, his disciples secretly asked him:
Why could not we cast him out? And he
said to them: This kind can go out by 
nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
