Rejoice to God our helper: sing aloud 
to the God of Jacob: take a pleasant 
psalm with the harp; blow the trumpet 
in the beginning of the month, for it is a 
commandment in Israel, and a 
judgment to the God of Jacob. (Ps. 80: 
6) He ordained it for a testimony in 
Joseph, when he came out of Egypt: he
heard a tongue which he knew not. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Rejoice to 
God our helper: sing aloud to the God 
of Jacob: take a pleasant psalm with 
the harp; below the trumpet in the 
beginning of the month, for it is a 
commandment in Israel, and a 
judgment to the God of Jacob.
Let us kneel. 
R. Arise.
