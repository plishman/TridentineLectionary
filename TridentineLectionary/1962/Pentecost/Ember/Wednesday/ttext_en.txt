The Liturgy of the Ember Day fasts possessed originally a distinctly festive 
quality, and was partly a festival of thanksgiving for the harvesting of the fruits 
of the season. These rustic feasts originated at Rome. The liturgy of this week 
has kept to a great extent unchanged its early festive character, which recalls so
vividly the rural feasts of ancient Rome at the close of the vintage. The idea of a
special preparation for the solemn Ordinations represents a later addition, 
which, however, dates from the time of Gelasius I.
The station on Ember Wednesday is, as a rule, at St. Mary Major, and the 
three Lessons in the Mass are a survival of the ancient Roman liturgical use, 
which recalls those very early times when, to the two Lessons from the Law and
the Prophets, customary in the synagogues of the Dispersion, the Apostles 
added a third lesson taken from the Gospels. The passage from the Gospel of 
St. Mark (9:16-28) teaches that humble prayer and fasting, spiritualize our 
nature, which is thus raised to a supernatural state, and render it invulnerable to
the fatal blows of Satan.
