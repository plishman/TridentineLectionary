In those days: It came to pass, while
Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul having
passed through the upper coasts, 
came to Ephesus, and found certain 
disciples. And he said to them: Have 
you received the Holy Ghost since ye 
believed? But they said to him: We 
have not so much as heard whether 
there be a Holy Ghost. And he said: In 
what then were you baptized? Who 
said: In John's baptism. Then Paul 
said: John baptized the people with 
the baptism of penance, saying: That 
they should believe in him who was to 
come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.
Having heard these things, they were 
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
And when Paul had imposed his hands
on them, the Holy Ghost came upon 
them, and they spoke with tongues 
and prophesied. And all the men were 
about twelve. And entering into the 
synagogue, he spoke boldly for the 
space of three months, disputing and 
exhorting concerning the kingdom of 
God.
