Grant, we beseech Thee, Almighty 
God: that the splendour of Thy 
brightness may shine forth among us; 
and that the light of Thy light may, by 
the illumination of the Holy Spirit, 
strengthen the hearts of them who 
through Thy grace are born again. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
