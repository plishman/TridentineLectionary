In ancient times Baptism was administered on this night in the Lateran 
exactly as on Easter Eve; but in the Twelfth Century, when the ceremony had 
already been anticipated on the afternoon of Holy Saturday, the Pope went at 
sunset to celebrate solemnly Vespers and Matins at St. Peter's.
Throughout the Mass there are references to Baptism and Confirmation. 
Although Baptism is distinct from Confirmation, yet the latter takes its name of 
Confirmatio from the fact that the coming down of the Holy Ghost into the soul 
of the neophyte completes the work of his supernatural regeneration. Through 
its sacramental character it confers on him a more perfect likeness to Jesus 
Christ, impressing on his soul the final seal or ratification of his union with the 
divine Redeemer.
