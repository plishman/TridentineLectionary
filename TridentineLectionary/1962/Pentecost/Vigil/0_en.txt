When I prove My holiness through you,
I will gather you from all the foreign 
lands; and I will sprinkle clean water 
upon you to cleanse you from all your 
impurities; and I will give you a new 
spirit, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 33: 2) I will 
bless the Lord at all times; His praise 
shall be ever in my mouth. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. When I prove My holiness
through you, I will gather you from all 
the foreign lands; and I will sprinkle 
clean water upon you to cleanse you 
from all your impurities; and I will give 
you a new spirit, alleluia, alleluia.
