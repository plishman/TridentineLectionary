God in His holy place; God who makes 
men of one mind to dwell in a house: 
He shall give power and strength to His
people. (Ps. 67: 2) Let God arise and 
let His enemies be scattered: and let 
them that hate Him flee from before His
face. Glory be to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in 
the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. God in 
His holy place; God who makes men of
one mind to dwell in a house: He shall 
give power and strength to His people.
