Brethren, I make known unto you the 
Gospel which I preached to you, which 
also you have received and wherein 
you stand, by which also you are 
saved, if you hold fast after what 
manner I preached unto you, unless 
you have believed in vain. For I 
delivered unto you first of all, which I 
also received, how that Christ died for 
our sins according to the Scriptures; 
and that He was buried, and that He 
rose again the third day according to 
the Scriptures; and that He was seen 
by Cephas, and after that by the 
eleven. Then He was seen by more 
than five hundred brethren at once; of 
whom many remain until this present, 
but some are fallen asleep. After that 
He was seen by James, then by all the 
Apostles. And last of all He was seen 
also by me, as by one born out of due 
time. For I am the least of the Apostles,
who am not worthy to be called an 
Apostle, because I persecuted the 
Church of God. But by the grace of 
God I am what I am and His grace in 
me hath not been void.
