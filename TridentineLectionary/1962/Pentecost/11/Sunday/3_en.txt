In God hath my heart confided, and I 
have been helped; and my flesh hath 
flourished again; and with my will I will 
give praise to Him. Unto Thee have I 
cried, O Lord: O my God, be not Thou 
silent: depart not from me. Alleluia, 
alleluia. (Ps. 80: 2, 3) Rejoice in God 
our helper sing: aloud to the God of 
Jacob, take a pleasant psalm with the 
harp. Alleluia.
