At that time, Jesus going out to the 
coasts of Tyre, came by Sidon to the 
Sea of Galilee, through the midst of the
coasts of Decapolis. And they bring to 
Him one deaf and dumb, and they 
besought Him that He would lay His 
hand upon him. And taking him from 
the multitude apart, He put His fingers 
into his ears, and spitting, He touched 
his tongue and looking up to heaven, 
He groaned and said to him: Ephpheta,
that is, Be thou opened: and 
immediately his ears were opened, and
the string of his tongue was loosed, 
and he spoke right. And He charged 
them that they should tell no man: but 
the more He charged them so much 
the more a great deal did they publish 
it; and so much the more did they 
wonder, saying: He hath done all things
well; He hath made both the deaf to 
hear, and the dumb to speak.
