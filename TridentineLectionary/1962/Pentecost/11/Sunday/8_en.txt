By the reception of Thy Sacrament, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, may we find 
support for mind and body: so that, 
healed in both, we may glory in the 
fullness of the heavenly remedy. 
Through the same Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
