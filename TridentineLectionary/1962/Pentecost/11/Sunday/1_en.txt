O almighty and everlasting God, who in
the abundance of Thy loving kindness 
art wont to go beyond both the merits 
and prayers of Thy suppliant people, 
pour down upon us Thy mercy: that 
Thou may forgive us those things 
whereof our conscience is afraid, and 
grant us what our prayer does not dare 
to ask. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
