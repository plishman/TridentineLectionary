O God, Who in this wonderful 
sacrament has left us a memorial of 
Thy passion: grant us, we beseech 
Thee, so to venerate the sacred 
mysteries of Thy Body and Blood, that 
we may ever perceive within us the fruit
of Thy redemption. Who lives and 
reigns with God the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
