At that time Jesus said to the 
multitudes of the Jews: My Flesh is 
meat indeed, and My Blood is drink 
indeed. He that eateth My Flesh, and 
drinketh My Blood, abideth in Me, and I
in him. As the living Father hath sent 
Me, and I live by the Father, so he that 
eateth Me, the same also shall live by
Me. This is the bread that came down
from Heaven. Not as your fathers did 
eat manna and are dead. He that 
eateth this Bread shall live for ever.
