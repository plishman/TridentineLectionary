He fed them with the best of wheat, 
alleluia; and filled them with honey from
the rock, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
(Ps. 80: 2) Sing joyfully to God our 
strength; acclaim the God of Jacob. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. He fed them
with the best of wheat, alleluia; and 
filled them with honey from the rock, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
