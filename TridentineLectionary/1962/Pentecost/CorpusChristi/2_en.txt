Brethren, I have received of the Lord, 
that which also I delivered to you, that 
the Lord Jesus, the same night in which
He was betrayed, took bread, and 
giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye 
and eat, this is My Body which shall be 
delivered for you; this do for the 
commemoration of Me. In like manner 
also the chalice, after He had supped, 
saying: This chalice is the new 
testament in My Blood; this do ye, as 
often as you shall drink, for the 
commemoration of Me. For as often as 
you shall eat this bread and drink this 
chalice, you shall show the death of the
Lord until He come. Therefore 
whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink
of the chalice of the Lord unworthily, 
shall be guilty of the Body and the 
Blood of the Lord. But let a man prove 
himself; and so let him eat of that 
bread, and drink of the chalice. For he 
that eateth and drinketh unworthily, 
eateth and drinketh judgment to 
himself, not discerning the Body of the 
Lord.
