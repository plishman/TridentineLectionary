In every Mass, the words "The Mystery of Faith" are said by the priest at the
Consecration. Today’s feast celebrates the mystery that is Transubstantiation. 
Two months ago on Holy Thursday, the Lord’s Last Supper was celebrated in 
the somber time of Lent. The Body of Christ was taken in procession to be 
reposed before His death on Good Friday. Today, the first Thursday after the 
close of the Easter season and the octave of Pentecost, the Church again 
celebrates this Mystery with a joyous Mass and a procession thereafter.
The Introit tells us to "sing joyfully to God." The Sequence (by St. Thomas 
Aquinas) "explains" in so far as a mystery can be explained, "This is the dogma 
given to Christians, that bread is changed into Flesh and wine into Blood. What 
thou dost not understand, what thou dost not see, a lively faith confirms in a 
supernatural manner." Only the Epistle, an excerpt from Holy Thursday’s, 
sounds a cautious note, reminding us that we must be in a state of grace to 
partake of this great Mystery.
