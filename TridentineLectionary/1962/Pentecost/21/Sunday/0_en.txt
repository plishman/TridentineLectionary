All things are in Thy will, O Lord, and 
there is none that can resist Thy will: 
for Thou hast made all things, heaven 
and earth, and all things that are under 
the cope of heaven: Thou art Lord of 
all. (Ps. 118: 1) Blessed are the 
undefiled who walk in the way: who 
walk in the law of the Lord. Glory be to 
the Father and to the Son and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. All things are in Thy will, O 
Lord, and there is none that can resist 
Thy will: for Thou hast made all things, 
heaven and earth, and all things that 
are under the cope of heaven: Thou art
Lord of all.
