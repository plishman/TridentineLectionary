O Lord, we beseech Thee, to keep Thy 
household in continual godliness that, 
through Thy protection, it may be free 
from all adversities, and devotedly 
given to serve Thee in good works to 
the glory of Thy Name. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
