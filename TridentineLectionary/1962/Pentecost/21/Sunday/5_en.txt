There was a man in the land of Hus, 
whose name was Job, simple, and 
upright, and fearing God: whom Satan 
besought that he might tempt: and 
power was given him from the Lord 
over his possessions and his flesh; and
he destroyed all his substance and his 
children; and wounded his flesh also 
with a grievous ulcer.
