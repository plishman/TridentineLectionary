Brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, 
and in the might of His power. Put you 
on the armor of God, that you may be 
able to stand against the deceits of the 
devil. For our wrestling is not against 
flesh and blood, but against 
principalities and powers, against the 
rulers of the world of this darkness, 
against the spirits of wickedness in the 
high places. Therefore take unto you 
the armor of God, that you may be able
to resist in the evil day, and to stand in 
all things perfect. Stand therefore 
having your loins girt about with truth, 
and having on the breastplate of 
justice, and your feet shod with the 
preparation of the gospel of peace; in 
all things taking the shield of faith, 
wherewith you may be able to 
extinguish all the fiery darts of the most
wicked one. And take unto you the 
helmet of salvation, and the sword of 
the Spirit, which is the word of God.
