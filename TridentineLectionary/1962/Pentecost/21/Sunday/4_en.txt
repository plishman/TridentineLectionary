At that time, Jesus spoke to His 
disciples this parable: The kingdom of 
heaven is likened to a king, who would 
take an account of his servants. And 
when he had begun to take the 
account, one was brought to him that 
owed him ten thousand talents: and as 
he had not wherewith to pay it, his lord 
commanded that he should be sold, 
and his wife and children, and all that 
he had, and payment be made. But 
that servant falling down, besought him
saying: Have patience with me, and I 
will pay thee all. And the lord of that 
servant, being moved with pity, let him 
go and forgave him the debt. But when 
that servant was gone out, he found 
one of his fellow servants that owed 
him a hundred pence: and laying hold 
of him, he throttled him, saying: Pay 
what thou owest. And his fellow-servant
falling down besought him, saying: 
Have patience with me, and I will pay 
thee all. And he would not but went and
cast him into prison till he paid the debt.
Now his fellow servants, seeing what 
was done, were very much grieved; 
and they came and told their lord all 
that was done. Then his lord called him
and saith to him: Thou wicked servant, 
I forgave thee all the debt, because 
thou besought me; should not thou 
have had compassion also on thy 
fellow servant, even as I had 
compassion on thee? And his lord 
being angry, delivered him to the 
torturers, until he paid all the debt. So 
also shall my heavenly Father do to 
you, if you forgive not every one his 
brother from your hearts.
