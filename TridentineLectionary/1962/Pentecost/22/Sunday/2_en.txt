Brethren, We are confident in the Lord 
Jesus, that He who hath begun a good 
work in you, will perfect it unto the day 
of Christ Jesus. As it is meet for me to 
think this for you all, for that I have you 
in my heart, and tha,t in my bands, and 
in the defense and confirmation of the 
Gospel, you are all partakers of my joy. 
For God is my witness, how I long after 
you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 
And this I pray, that your charity may 
more and more abound in knowledge 
and in all understanding; that you may 
approve the better things; that you may
be sincere and without offense unto the
day of Christ: filled with the fruit of 
justice, through Jesus Christ unto the 
glory and praise of God.
