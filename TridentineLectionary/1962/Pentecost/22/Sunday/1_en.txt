O God, our refuge and our strength, 
who art the Author of all godliness, be 
ready to hear the devout prayers of the 
Church, and grant that what we ask 
faithfully we may obtain effectually. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with You in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
