If Thou shalt observe iniquities, O Lord,
Lord, who shall endure it? for with Thee
is propitiation, O God of Israel. (Ps 129:
1-2) From the depths I have cried to 
Thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. If Thou shalt
observe iniquities, O Lord, Lord, who 
shall endure it? for with Thee is 
propitiation, O God of Israel.
