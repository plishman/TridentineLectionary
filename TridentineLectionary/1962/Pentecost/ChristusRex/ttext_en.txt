This feast was instituted by Pope Pius XI at the close of the Holy Year, 
1925. The purpose of the Holy Father was to bring home to all mankind the fact 
that Christ is King not merely over individuals, but over families and societies, 
over states and nations, over rulers and tribunals as well. The duty of Catholics 
is to hasten the return of the world to His authority by their prayers, their 
influence, and their actions. They are reminded that they must courageously 
fight under His royal banner, with the weapons of the spirit, for the rights of God 
and of His Church.
The last Sunday of October was chosen for the feast, the Sunday preceding
All Saints, because during this month the liturgical year draws to its close and 
thus the mysteries of Jesus Christ are fittingly completed and crowned by the 
liturgical festival of Christ, the King. On the same day also will annually take 
place the consecration of mankind to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Christ is 
proclaimed King of all mankind both in the Old and the New Testament. David, 
Isaias, Daniel and Zacharias in plainest terms predicted the kingship or the 
kingdom of the future Messiah. At the coming of Christ the Angel Gabriel 
announced that "of His Kingdom there shall be no end." The Savior Himself 
declared His kingship before Pilate. But His kingdom, though in this world, was 
not to be of this world. On the last day He will present Himself together with His 
kingdom to His Father, when all His enemies shall have been put under His feet.
