The Lamb that was slain is worthy to 
receive power and divinity and wisdom 
and strength and honor: to Him be 
glory and empire for ever and ever. (Ps.
71: 1) Give to the King, O God, Thy 
judgment, and to the King's Son Thy 
justice. Glory be to the Father and to 
the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was
in the beginning, is now and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. The 
Lamb that was slain is worthy to 
receive power and divinity and wisdom 
and strength and honor: to Him be 
glory and empire for ever and ever.
