At that time: Pilate said to Jesus: Art 
thou the King of the Jews? Jesus 
answered: Sayest thou this thing of 
thyself, or have others told it thee of 
Me? Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy 
own nation, and the chief priests, have 
delivered thee up to me: what hast thou
done? Jesus answered: My kingdom is
not of this world. If My kingdom were of
this world, My servants would certainly 
strive that I should not be delivered to 
the Jews: but now My kingdom is not 
from hence. Pilate therefore said to 
him: Art thou a king then? Jesus 
answered: Thou sayest that I am a 
King. For this was I born, and for this 
came I into the world; that I should give
testimony to the truth, everyone that is 
of the truth, heareth My voice.
