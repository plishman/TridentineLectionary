Brethren, we give thanks to God the 
Father, Who hath made us worthy to be
partakers of the lot of the saints in light:
Who hath delivered us from the power 
of darkness, and hath translated us into
the kingdom of the Son of His love. In 
Whom we have redemption through His
blood, the remission of sins; Who is the
image of the invisible God, the firstborn
of every creature: for in Him were all 
things created in Heaven and on earth, 
visible and invisible, whether thrones, 
or dominations, or principalities, or 
powers: aIl things were created by Him 
and in Him. And He is before all, and by
Him all things consist. And He is the 
head of the body, the Church. Who is 
the beginning, the firstborn from the 
dead; that in all things He may hold the 
primacy: because in Him it hath well 
pleased the Father that all fullness 
should dwell; and through Him to 
reconcile all things unto Himself, 
making peace through the blood of His 
cross, both as to the things that are on 
earth, and the things that are in 
Heaven, in Christ Jesus Our Lord.
