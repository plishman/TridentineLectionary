He shall rule from sea to sea, and from 
the river unto the ends of the earth. And
all kings of the earth shall adore Him: 
all nations shall serve Him. Alleluia, 
alleluia. (Dan. 7: 14) His power is an 
everlasting power that shall not be 
taken away: and His kingdom that shall
not be destroyed. Alleluia.
