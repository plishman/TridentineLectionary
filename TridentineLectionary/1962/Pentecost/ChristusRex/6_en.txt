O Lord, we offer Thee this host for the 
reconciliation of humanity; grant, we 
beseech Thee, that Jesus Christ Thy 
Son our Lord, Whom we immolate in 
this sacrifice, will bestow on all Gentiles
the gifts of unity and peace, Who with 
Thee lives and reigns in the unity of the
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
