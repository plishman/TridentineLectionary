Almighty and eternal God, Who hast 
wished to restore all things through Thy
beloved Son, the King of the universe, 
graciously grant that all the families of 
the Gentiles separated by the wound of
sin, may be subjected to His most 
loving dominion, Who with Thee lives 
and reigns in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
