It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation, that we should at all 
times and in all places, give thanks 
unto Thee, O holy Lord, Father 
almighty, everlasting God Who didst 
anoint with the oil of gladness Thine 
only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus 
Christ, eternal Priest and King of the 
universe: that, offering Himself as a 
stainless peace-offering on the altar of 
the cross, He might fulfill the pledges of
man's redemption; and, having all 
creatures subject to His power, might 
deliver to Thy sublime majesty an 
eternal and universal kingdom, a 
kingdom of truth and life; a kingdom of 
holiness and grace, a kingdom of 
justice, love and peace. And therefore 
with the Angels and Archangels, with 
the Thrones and Dominations, and with
all the array of the heavenly host, we 
sing a hymn to Thy glory and 
unceasingly repeat:
