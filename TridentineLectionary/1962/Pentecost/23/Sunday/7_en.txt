We offer to Thee, O Lord, this sacrifice 
of praise, as an increase of our service:
that what Thou hast conferred on us 
who are unworthy, Thou may mercifully
accomplish. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
