At that time, as Jesus was speaking to 
the multitudes, behold a certain ruler 
came up, and adored Him, saying: 
Lord, my daughter is even now dead; 
but come lay Thy hand upon her, and 
she shall live. And Jesus, rising up, 
followed him, with His disciples. And 
behold a woman, who was troubled 
with an issue of blood twelve years, 
came behind Him, and touched the 
hem of His garment. For she said 
within herself: If I shall touch only His 
garment, I shall be healed. But Jesus 
turning and seeing her, said: Be of 
good heart, daughter, thy faith hath 
made thee whole. And the woman was 
made whole from that hour. And when 
Jesus was come into the house of the 
ruler, and saw the minstrels and the 
multitude making a tumult, He said: 
Give place; for the girl is not dead, but 
sleeps. And they laughed Him to scorn. 
And when the multitude was put forth, 
He went in and took her by the hand. 
And the maid arose. And the fame 
thereof went abroad into all that 
country.
