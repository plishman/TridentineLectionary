O Lord, we beseech Thee, absolve Thy
people from their offenses, that through
Thy bountiful goodness, we may be 
freed from the bonds of those sins, 
which by our frailty we have committed.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with You in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
