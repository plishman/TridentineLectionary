Let the appointed sacrifices be offered 
to Thee, O Lord: which Thou hast 
granted so to be offered to the honor of
Thy Name, that they may themselves 
become healing remedies unto us. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
