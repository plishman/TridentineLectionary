O God who dost manifest Thine 
almighty power most chiefly in sparing 
and showing mercy: multiply upon us 
Thy mercy: that as we hasten towards 
Thy promises, Thou may make us 
partakers of the heavenly treasures. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
