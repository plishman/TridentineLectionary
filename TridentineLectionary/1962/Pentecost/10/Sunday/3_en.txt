Keep me, O Lord, as the apple of Thine
eye: protect me under the shadow of 
Thy wings. Let my judgment come 
forth from Thy countenance: let Thine 
eyes behold the thing that is equitable. 
Alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 64: 2) A hymn, O
God, becometh Thee in Sion: and a 
vow shall be paid to Thee in Jerusalem.
Alleluia.
