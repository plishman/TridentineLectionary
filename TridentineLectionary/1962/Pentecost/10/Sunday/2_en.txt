Brethren, You know that, when you 
were heathens, you went to dumb 
idols, according as you were led, 
Wherefore I give you to understand, 
that no man, speaking by the Spirit of 
God, saith Anathema to Jesus and no 
man can say, The Lord Jesus, but by 
the Holy Spirit. Now there are 
diversities of graces, but the same 
Spirit; and there are diversities of 
ministries, but the same Lord; and 
there are diversities of operations, but 
the same God, who works in all. And 
the manifestation of the Spirit is given 
to every man unto profit. To one 
indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word 
of wisdom; and to another, the word of 
knowledge, according to the same 
Spirit; to another, the grace of healing 
in one Spirit; to another, the working of 
miracles; to another, prophecy; to 
another, the discerning of spirits; to 
another, divers kinds of tongues; to 
another, interpretation of speeches. But
all these things one and the same Spirit
works, dividing to every one according 
as He will.
