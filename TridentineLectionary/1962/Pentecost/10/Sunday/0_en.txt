When I cried to the Lord He heard my 
voice, from them that draw near to me: 
and He humbled them, Who is before 
all ages, and remains forever: cast thy 
care upon the Lord, and He shall 
sustain thee. (Ps. 54: 2) Hear, O God, 
my prayer, and despise not my 
supplication; be attentive to me and 
hear me. Glory be to the Father, and to
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen.
