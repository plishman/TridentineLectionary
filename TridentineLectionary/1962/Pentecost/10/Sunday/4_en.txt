At that time, Jesus spoke this parable 
to some who trusted in themselves as 
just and despised others. Two men 
went up into the temple to pray: the one
was a pharisee, and the other a 
publican. The pharisee standing, 
prayed thus with himself: O God, I give 
Thee thanks that I am not as the rest of
men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers; as
also is this publican. I fast twice in the 
week; I give tithes of all that I possess. 
And the publican standing afar off 
would not so much as lift up his eyes 
towards heaven, but struck his breast 
saying: O God, be merciful to me a 
sinner. I say to you, this man went 
down to his house justified rather than 
the other: because every one that 
exalts himself shall be humbled, and he
that humbles himself shall be exalted.
