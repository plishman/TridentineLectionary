At that time Jesus spoke to the 
Pharisees this parable: A certain man 
made a great supper, and invited many.
And he sent his servant, at the hour of 
the supper, to say them that were 
invited, that they should come, for now 
all things were ready. And they began 
all at once to make excuse. The first 
said to him: I have bought a farm, and 
must needs go out, and see it: I pray 
thee hold me excused. And another 
said: I have bought five yoke of oxen, 
and I go to try them; I pray thee hold 
me excused. And another said: I have
married a wife, and therefore I cannot 
come. And the servant returning, told 
these things to his lord. Then the 
master of the house being angry, said 
to his servant: Go out quickly into the 
streets and lanes of the city, and bring 
in hither the poor, and the feeble, and 
the blind, and the lame. And the 
servant said: Lord, it is done as thou 
hast commanded, and yet there is 
room. And the lord said to the servant: 
Go out into the highways and hedges, 
and compel them to come in, that my 
house may be filled. But I say unto you,
that none of these men that were 
invited shall taste of my supper.
