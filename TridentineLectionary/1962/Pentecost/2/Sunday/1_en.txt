Make us, O Lord, to have alike a fear 
and a love of Thy holy Name in 
perpetuity: for Thou dost never deprive 
of Thy guidance those whom Thou dost
establish steadfastly in Thy love. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
