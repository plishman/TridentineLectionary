The Lord became my protector, and He
brought me forth into a large place: he 
saved me, because He was well 
pleased with me. (Ps. 17. 2, 3) I will 
love Thee, O Lord my strength: the 
Lord is my firmament, and my refuge, 
and my deliverer. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. The Lord became my 
protector, and He brought me forth into 
a large place: he saved me, because 
He was well pleased with me.
