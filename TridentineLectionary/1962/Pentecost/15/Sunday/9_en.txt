May the efficacy of the heavenly Gift, 
we beseech Thee, O Lord, possess our
minds and bodies: so that its effects, 
and not our own impulses, may ever 
prevail in us. Through the same Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
