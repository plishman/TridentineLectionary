Brethren, if we live in the spirit, let us 
also walk in the spirit. Let us not be 
made desirous of vain glory, provoking 
one another, envying one another. 
Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in 
any fault, you, who are spiritual, 
instruct such a one in the spirit of 
meekness, considering thyself, lest 
thou also be tempted. Bear ye 
another's burdens, and so you shall 
fulfill the law of Christ. For if any man 
think himself to be something, whereas 
he is nothing, he deceives himself. But 
let everyone prove his own work, and 
so he shall have glory in himself only, 
and not in another. For everyone shall 
bear his own burden. And let him that is
instructed in the word, communicate to 
him that instructs him, in all good 
things. Be not deceived, God is not 
mocked; for what things a man shall 
sow, those also will he reap. For he that
sows in his flesh, of the flesh also shall 
reap corruption: but he that sows in the 
spirit, of the spirit shall reap life 
everlasting. And in doing good, let us 
not fail; for in due time we shall reap, 
not failing. Therefore, whilst we have 
time, let us work good to all men, but 
especially to those who are of the 
household of the faith.
