At that time, Jesus went into a city 
called Naim: and there went with Him 
His disciples, and a great multitude. 
And when He came nigh to the gate of 
the city, behold a dead man was 
carried out, the only son of his mother, 
and she was a widow, and a great 
multitude of the city were with her. And 
when the Lord had seen her, He had 
compassion on her, and said to her: 
Weep not. And He came near and 
touched the bier. And they that carried 
it stood still. And He said: Young man, I 
say to thee, Arise. And he that was 
dead, sat up, and began to speak. And 
He delivered him to his mother. And 
there came a fear on them all: and they
glorified God, saying: A great prophet is
risen up among us, and God has 
visited His people.
