Bow down Thine ear, O Lord, to me 
and hear me: save Thy servant, O my 
God, that trusteth in Thee: have mercy 
on me, O Lord, for I have cried to Thee 
all day. (Ps. 85: 4) Give joy to the soul 
of Thy servant for to thee, O Lord, I 
have lifted up my soul. Glory be to the 
Father and to the Son and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Bow down Thine ear, O 
Lord, to me and hear me: save Thy 
servant, O my God, that trusteth in 
Thee: have mercy on me, O Lord, for I 
have cried to Thee all day.
