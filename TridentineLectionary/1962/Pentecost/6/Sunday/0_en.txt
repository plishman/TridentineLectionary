The Lord is the strength of His people, 
and the protector of the salvation of His
anointed: save, O Lord, Thy people, 
and bless Thine inheritance, and rule 
them forever. (Ps. 27: 1) Unto thee will I
cry, O Lord: O my God, be not Thou 
silent to me, lest if Thou be silent to 
me, I become like them that go down 
into the pit. Glory be to the Father and 
to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. The
Lord is the strength of His people, and 
the protector of the salvation of His 
anointed: save, O Lord, Thy people, 
and bless Thine inheritance, and rule 
them forever.
