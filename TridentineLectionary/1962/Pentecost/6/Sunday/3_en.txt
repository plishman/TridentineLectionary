Return, O Lord, a little: and be 
entreated in favor of Thy servants. 
Lord, Thou hast been our refuge from 
generation to generation. Alleluia, 
alleluia. (Ps. 30: 2, 3) In Thee, O Lord, 
I have hoped, let me never be 
confounded: deliver me in Thy justice, 
and release me: bow down Thine ear to
me, make haste to deliver me. Alleluia.
