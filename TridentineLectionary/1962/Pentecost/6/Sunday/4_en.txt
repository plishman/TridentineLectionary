At that time, when there was a great 
multitude with Jesus, and they had 
nothing to eat, calling His disciples 
together, He saith to them: I have 
compassion on the multitude, for 
behold they have now been with Me 
three days, and have nothing to eat 
and if I shall send them away fasting to 
their home, they will faint in the way: for
some of them came from afar off. And 
His disciples answered Him: From 
whence can any one fill them here with 
bread in the wilderness? And he asked 
them: How many loaves have ye? Who
said: Seven. And He commanded the 
people to sit down on the ground. And 
taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, 
He broke and gave to His disciples to 
set before the people. And they had a 
few little fishes, and He blessed them, 
and commanded them to be set before 
them. And they did eat, and were filled: 
and they took up that which was left of 
the fragments, seven baskets: and they
that had eaten, were about four 
thousand: and He sent them away.
