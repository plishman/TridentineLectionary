O God of hosts, to Whom all that is 
best belong, graft in our hearts the love
of Thy name, and grant us an increase 
of true religion: that Thou mayest foster
what is good, and with tender zeal 
guard what Thou hast fostered. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
