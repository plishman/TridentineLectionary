Be appeased, O Lord, by our humble 
prayers, and favorably receive the 
offerings of Thy people: and that the 
prayers of none be vain, no one 
petition void, grant, that what we ask 
faithfully, we may obtain effectually. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
