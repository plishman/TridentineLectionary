All ye nations, clap your hands: shout 
unto God with the voice of joy. (Ps. 46: 
3) For the Lord is most high, He is 
terrible: a great King over all the earth. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. All ye 
nations, clap your hands: shout unto 
God with the voice of joy.
