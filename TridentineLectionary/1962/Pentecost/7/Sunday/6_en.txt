O God, who hast justified the variety of 
sacrifices of the Law by the perfection 
of this one Sacrifice: accept the 
Sacrifice of Thy servants who are 
dedicated to Thee, and sanctify it with a
blessing like to that which Thou didst 
bestow upon the gifts of Abel: that what
each one of us has offered to the honor
of Thy Majesty, may profit us all unto 
salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
