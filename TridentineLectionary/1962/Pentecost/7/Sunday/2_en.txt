Brethren: I speak a human thing, 
because of the infirmity of your flesh; 
for as you have yielded your members 
to serve uncleanness and iniquity for 
iniquity, so now yield your members to 
serve justice unto sanctification. For 
when you were the servants of sin, you 
were free from justice. What fruit 
therefore had you then in those things, 
of which you are now ashamed? For 
the end of them is death. But now 
being made free from sin, and become 
servants to God, you have your fruit 
unto sanctification, and the end life 
everlasting. For the wages of sin is 
death. But the grace of God is life 
everlasting; in Christ Jesus our Lord.
