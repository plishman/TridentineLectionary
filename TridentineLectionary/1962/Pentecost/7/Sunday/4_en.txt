At that time Jesus said to His disciples: 
Beware of false prophets, who come to 
you in the clothing of sheep, but 
inwardly they are ravening wolves. By 
their fruits you shall know them. Do 
men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of 
thistles? Even so every good tree 
bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil 
tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree 
cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can 
an evil tree bring forth good fruit. Every 
tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, 
shall be cut down, and shall be cast 
into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits 
you shall know them. Not every one 
that saith to Me: Lord, Lord, shall enter 
into the kingdom of heaven: but he that
doeth the will of My Father Who is in 
heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven.
