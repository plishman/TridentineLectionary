O God, whose providence faileth not in 
its designs, we humbly entreat Thee: to
put away from us all hurtful things, and 
to give us all things which be profitable 
for us. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
