O almighty and merciful God, 
graciously keep us from all things that 
may hurt us: that we, being set free 
both in body and soul, may willingly 
fulfill those things that Thou wouldst 
have done. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
