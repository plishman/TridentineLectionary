Brethren, Be ye renewed in the spirit of 
your mind, and put on the new man, 
who according ito God, is created in 
justice and holiness of truth. 
Wherefore, putting away lying, speak 
ye the truth every man with his 
neighbor, for we are members of one 
another. Be angry, and sin not. Let not 
the sun go down upon your anger. Give
not place to the devil. He that stole, let 
him now steal no more; but rather let 
him labor, working with his hands the 
thing which is good, that he may have 
something to give to him that suffers 
need.
