I am the salvation of the people, saith 
the Lord: in whatever tribulation they 
shall cry to Me, I will hear them and I 
will be their Lord for ever. (Ps. 77: 1) 
Attend, O my people, to My law; incline 
your ears to the words of My mouth. 
Glory be to the Father and to the Son 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. I am the 
salvation of the people, saith the Lord: 
in whatever tribulation they shall cry to 
Me, I will hear them and I will be their 
Lord for ever.
