At that time, Jesus spoke to the chief 
priests and the Pharisees in parables, 
saying: The kingdom of Heaven is 
likened to a king, who made a marriage
for his son; and he sent his servants, to
call them that were invited to the 
marriage, and they would not come. 
Again he sent other servants, saying: 
Tell them that were invited: Behold, I 
have prepared my dinner; my oxen and
fatlings are killed, and all things are 
ready: come ye to the marriage. But 
they neglected and went their way, one 
to his farm, and another to his 
merchandise; and the rest laid their 
hands on his servants, and having 
treated them abusively, put them to 
death. But when the king heard of it, he
was angry and sending his armies, he 
destroyed those murderers, and burnt 
their city. Then he saith to his servants: 
The marriage indeed is ready, but they 
that were invited were not worthy, Go 
ye therefore into the highways, and as 
many as you shall find, call to the 
marriage. And his servants going forth 
into the ways, gathered together all that
they found, both bad and good and the 
marriage was filled with guests. And the
king went in to see the guests, and he 
saw there a man who had not on a 
wedding garment: and he saith to him: 
Friend, how came thou in hither, not 
having on a wedding garment? But he 
was silent. Then the king said to the 
waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and 
cast him into the exterior darkness: 
there shall be weeping and gnashing of
teeth. For many are called, but few are 
chosen.
