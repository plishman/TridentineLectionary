Grant unto us, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, that this saving victim may both 
be the cleansing of our sins, and the 
appeasing of Thy might. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
We offer Thee prayers and sacrifices, 
O Lord Jesus Christ, humbly entreating
that we, who commemorate in our 
prayers the piercing of the most dear 
soul of blessed Mary, Thy Mother, may, 
through the multiplied intercession of 
her and of her holy companions under 
the cross, by the merits of Thy death, 
receive our portion with the blessed. 
Who lives and reigns with God the 
Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
