May Thy Sacraments, O God, ever 
cleanse and defend us; and lead us to 
the attainment of eternal salvation. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
May the sacrifices of which we have 
partaken, O Lord Jesus Christ, devoutly
celebrating the piercing of Thy virgin 
Mother's soul, obtain for us with Thy 
clemency the effect of every salutary 
benefit. Who lives and reigns with God 
the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
