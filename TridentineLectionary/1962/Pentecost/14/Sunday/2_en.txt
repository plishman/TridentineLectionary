Brethren, walk in the spirit, and you 
shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh: for 
the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the
spirit against the flesh; for these are 
contrary one to another; so that you do 
not the things that you would. But if you
are led by the spirit, you are not under 
the law. Now the works of the flesh are 
manifest, which are fornication, 
uncleanness, immodesty, luxury, 
idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, 
contentions, emulations, wraths, 
quarrels, dissensions, sects, envies, 
murders, drunkenness, revellings, and 
such like: of which I foretell you, as I 
have foretold to you, that they who do 
such things, shall not obtain the 
kingdom of God. But the fruit of the 
Spirit is charity, joy, peace, patience, 
benignity, goodness, longanimity, 
mildness, faith, modesty, continency, 
chastity. Against such there is no law. 
And they that are Christ's have 
crucified their flesh with the vices and 
concupiscences.
