Keep, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy 
Church with Thy perpetual mercy: and 
because without Thee the frailty of man
is wont to fall, save it ever by Thine aid 
from all things hurtful, and lead it to all 
things profitable to salvation. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
O God, at Whose Passion, according to
the prophecy of Simeon, a sword of 
sorrow pierced the most sweet soul of 
the glorious Virgin and Mother Mary: 
mercifully grant, that we who with 
devotion honor her Sorrows, may 
obtain the happy fruit of thy Passion: 
Who lives and reigns with God the 
Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
