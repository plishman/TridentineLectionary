Behold, O God, our protector, and look 
on the face of Thy Christ: for better is 
one day in Thy courts above 
thousands. (Ps. 83: 2, 3) How lovely 
are Thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! 
my soul longs and faints for the courts 
of the Lord. Glory be to the Father and 
to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Behold, O God, our protector, and look 
on the face of Thy Christ: for better is 
one day in Thy courts above 
thousands.
