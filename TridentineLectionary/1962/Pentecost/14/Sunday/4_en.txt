At that time Jesus said to His disciples: 
No man can serve two masters; for he 
will hate the one and love the other, or 
he will sustain the one and despise the 
other. You cannot serve God and 
mammon. Therefore I say to you, be 
not solicitous for your life, what you 
shall eat, nor for your body, what you 
shall put on. Is not the life more than 
the meat, and the body more than the 
raiment? Behold the birds of the air; for 
they neither sow nor do they reap, nor 
gather into barns, and your heavenly 
Father feeds them. Are you not of much
more value than they? And which of 
you, by taking thought, can add to his 
stature one cubit? And for raiment, why
are you solicitous? Consider the lilies of
the field, how they grow; they labor not,
neither do they spin: but I say to you, 
that not even Solomon in all his glory 
was arrayed as one of these. Now if 
God so clothe the grass of the field, 
which is today, and tomorrow is cast in 
the oven, how much more you, O ye of 
little faith! Be not solicitous therefore 
saying: What shall we eat, or what shall
we drink, or wherewith shall we be 
clothed? for after all these things do the
heathen seek. For your Father knows 
that you have need of all these things. 
Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of 
God, and His justice; and all these 
things shall be added unto you.
