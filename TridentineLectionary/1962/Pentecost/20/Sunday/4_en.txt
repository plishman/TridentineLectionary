At that time, there was a certain ruler 
whose son was sick at Capharnaum. 
He, having heard that Jesus was come 
from Jud√¶a into Galilee, went to Him, 
and prayed Him to come down, and 
heal his son for he was at the point of 
death. Jesus therefore said to him: 
Unless you see signs and wonders, 
you believe not. The ruler saith to Him: 
Lord, come down before my son die. 
Jesus saith to him: Go on thy way, thy 
son lives. The man believed the word 
which Jesus had said to him, and went 
his way. And as he was going down, his
servants met him, and they brought 
word, saying that his son lived. He 
asked therefore of them the hour 
wherein he grew better. And they said 
to him: Yesterday at the seventh hour 
the fever left him. The father therefore 
knew that it was at the same hour that 
Jesus said to him: Thy son lives; and 
himself believed, and his whole house.
