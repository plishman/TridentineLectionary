The eyes of all hope in Thee, O Lord, 
and Thou givest them meat in due 
season. Thou openest Thy hand, and 
fills every living creature with Thy 
blessing. Alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 107: 2) 
My heart is ready, O God, my heart is 
ready: I will sing, and will give praise to 
Thee, my glory. Alleluia.
