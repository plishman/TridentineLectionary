Brethren: See how you walk 
circumspectly, not as unwise, but as 
wise; redeeming the time, because the 
days are evil. Wherefore, become not 
unwise, but understanding what is the 
will of God. And be not drunk with wine,
wherein is luxury: but be ye filled with 
the Holy Spirit, speaking to yourselves 
in psalms and hymns and spiritual 
canticles, singing and making melody 
in your hearts to the Lord: giving thanks
always for all things, in the Name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the 
Father; being subject one to another in 
the fear of Christ.
