In Thy mercy, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, grant to Thy faithful people 
pardon and peace, that they may be 
cleansed from all their sins and also 
serve Thee with a quiet mind. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
