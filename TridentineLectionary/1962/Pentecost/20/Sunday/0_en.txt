All that Thou hast done to us, O Lord, 
Thou hast done in true judgment: 
because we have sinned against Thee,
and we have not obeyed Thy 
commandments: but give glory to Thy 
Name, and deal with us according to 
the multitude of Thy mercy. (Ps. 118: 1)
Blessed are the undefiled in the way 
who walk in the law of the Lord. Glory 
be to the Father and to the Son and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. All that Thou 
hast done to us, O Lord, Thou hast 
done in true judgment: because we 
have sinned against Thee, and we 
have not obeyed Thy commandments: 
but give glory to Thy Name, and deal 
with us according to the multitude of 
Thy mercy.
