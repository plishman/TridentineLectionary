Forgive us our sins, O Lord, lest the 
Gentiles should at any time say: Where
is their God? Help us, O God, our 
Savior and for the honor of Thy Name, 
O Lord, deliver us. Alleluia, alleluia. 
(Ps. 9: 5, 10) O God, who sittest upon 
the throne, and judgest justice, be Thou
the refuge of the poor in tribulation. 
Alleluia.
