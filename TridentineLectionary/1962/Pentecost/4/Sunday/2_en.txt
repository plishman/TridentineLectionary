Brethren, I reckon that the sufferings of 
this time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory that is to come, that shall 
be revealed to us. For the expectation 
of the creature waiteth for the 
revelation of the sons of God, for the 
creature was made subject to vanity, 
not willingly, but by reason of him that 
made it subject in hope; because the 
creature also itself shall be delivered 
from the servitude of corruption, into 
the liberty of the glory of the children of 
God. For we know that every creature 
groaneth, and travaileth in pain, even 
till now and not only it, but ourselves 
also, who have the first fruits of the 
Spirit, even we ourselves groan within 
ourselves, waiting for the adoption of 
the sons of God, the redemption of our 
body in Christ Jesus Our Lord.
