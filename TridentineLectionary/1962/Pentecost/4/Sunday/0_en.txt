The Lord is my light and my salvation: 
whom shall I fear? The Lord is the 
protector of my life: of whom shall I be 
afraid? My enemies that trouble me 
have themselves been weakened and 
have fallen. (Ps. 26: 3) If armies in 
camp should stand together against 
me, my heart shall not fear. Glory be to 
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. The Lord is my light and 
my salvation: whom shall I fear? The 
Lord is the protector of my life: of whom
shall I be afraid? My enemies that 
trouble me have themselves been 
weakened and have fallen.
