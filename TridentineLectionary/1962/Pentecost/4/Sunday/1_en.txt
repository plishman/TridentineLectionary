Grant us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
that both the course of this world may 
be peacefully ordered for us by Thy 
governance, and that Thy Church may 
rejoice in quiet devotion. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
