At that time, when the multitude 
pressed upon Jesus to hear the word of
God, He stood by the lake of 
Genesareth. And He saw two ships 
standing by the lake; but the fishermen 
were gone out of them, and were 
washing their nets. And going up into 
one of the ships that was Simon's, He 
desired him to draw back a little from 
the land: and sitting He taught the 
multitudes out of the ship. Now when 
He had ceased to speak, He said to 
Simon: Launch out into the deep, and 
let down your nets for a draught. And 
Simon, answering, said to Him: Master,
we have labored all the night, and have
taken nothing, but at Thy word I will let 
down the net. And when they had 
done this, they enclosed a very great 
multitude of fishes and their net broke: 
and they beckoned to their partners 
that were in the other ship, that they 
should come and help them and they 
came, and filled both the ships, so that 
they were almost sinking. Which when 
Simon Peter saw, he fell down at 
Jesus' knees, saying: Depart from me, 
for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For he 
was wholly astonished, and all that 
were with him, at the draught of fishes 
which they had taken: and so were also
James and John the sons of Zebedee, 
who were Simon's partners. And Jesus 
saith to Simon: Fear not, from 
henceforth thou shalt catch men. And 
having brought their ships to land, 
leaving all things, they followed Him.
