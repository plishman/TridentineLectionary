Look graciously, O Lord, upon Thy 
people: graciously look upon our gifts 
that, being appeased by this offering, 
Thou may both grant us pardon, and 
give us what we ask. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Let the humanity of Thine only-
begotten Son succor us, O Lord, that 
He, Who, born of a virgin, did not 
diminish, but consecrated, the virginity 
of His mother, may, on this solemn 
festival of her Nativity, deliver us from 
our sins and make our offering 
acceptable, even Jesus Christ our 
Lord, Who with Thee lives and reigns, 
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
