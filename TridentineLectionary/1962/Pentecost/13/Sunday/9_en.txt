We who have received the heavenly 
Sacraments, beseech Thee, O Lord, 
that we may increasingly advance 
towards eternal redemption. Through 
the same Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
We have partaken of the solemn 
sacrament on this annual feast: grant 
we beseech Thee, that it may bring us 
assistance both for the present and for 
life everlasting. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
