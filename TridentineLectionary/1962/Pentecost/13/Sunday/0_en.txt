Have regard, O Lord, to Thy covenant, 
and forsake not to the end the souls of 
Thy poor: arise, O Lord, and judge Thy 
cause, and forget not the voices of 
them that seek Thee. (Ps. 73: 1) O 
God, why hast Thou cast us off unto 
the end: why is Thy wrath enkindled 
against the sheep of Thy pasture? 
Glory be to the Father and to the Son 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Have regard,
O Lord, to Thy covenant, and forsake 
not to the end the souls of Thy poor: 
arise, O Lord, and judge Thy cause, 
and forget not the voices of them that 
seek Thee.
