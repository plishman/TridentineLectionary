At that time, as Jesus was going to 
Jerusalem, He passed through the 
midst of Samaria and Galilee: and as 
He entered into a certain town, there 
met Him ten men that were lepers, who
stood afar off, and lifted up their voice, 
saying: Jesus, Master, have mercy on 
us. Whom when He saw, He said: Go, 
show yourselves to the priests. And it 
came to pass, that, as they went, they 
were made clean. And one of them, 
when he saw that he was made clean, 
went back, with a loud voice glorifying 
God: and he fell on his face before His 
feet, giving thanks: and this was a 
Samaritan. And Jesus answering said: 
Were not ten made clean? And where 
are the nine? There is no one found to 
return, and give glory to God, but this 
stranger. And He said to him: Arise, go 
thy way for thy faith hath made thee 
whole.
