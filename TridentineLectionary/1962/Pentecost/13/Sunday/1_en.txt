Almighty and everlasting God, give 
unto us the increase of faith, hope and 
charity: and, that we may deserve to 
obtain what Thou dost promise, make 
us to love that which Thou dost 
command. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Impart unto Thy servants, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, the gift of Thy heavenly 
grace, that to us, for whom the 
childbearing of the Blessed Virgin was 
the beginning of our salvation, the 
votive solemnity of her nativity may 
give increase of peace. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
