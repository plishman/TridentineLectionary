Brethren, To Abraham were the 
promises made, and to his seed. He 
saith not: And to his seeds, as of many;
but as of one: And to thy seed, which is
Christ. Now this I say, that the 
testament which was confirmed by 
God, the law which was made after four
hundred and thirty years, doth not 
disannul to make the promise of no 
effect. For if the inheritance be of the 
law it is no more of promise. But God 
gave it to Abraham by promise. Why 
then was the law? It was set because 
of transgressions until the seed should 
come, to whom He made the promise, 
being ordained by angels in the hand of
a mediator. Now a mediator is not of 
one: but God is one. Was the law then 
against the promises of God? God 
forbid. For if there had been a law 
given, which could give life, verily 
justice should have been by the law. 
But the Scripture hath concluded all 
under sin, that the promise by the faith 
of Jesus Christ might be given to them 
that believe.
