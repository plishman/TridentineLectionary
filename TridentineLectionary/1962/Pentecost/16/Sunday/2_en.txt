Brethren, I pray you not to faint at my 
tribulations for you, which are your 
glory. For this cause I bow my knees to
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of 
whom all paternity in heaven and earth 
is named, that He would grant you, 
according to the riches of His glory, to 
be strengthened by His Spirit with 
might unto the inward man, That Christ 
may dwell by faith in your hearts; that 
being rooted and founded in charity, 
you may be able to comprehend with 
all the saints, what is the breadth, and 
the length, and height, and depth. To 
know also the charity of Christ, which 
surpasses all knowledge; that you may 
be filled unto all the fullness of God. 
Now to Him Who is able to do all things
more abundantly than we desire or 
understand, according to the power 
that works in us: to Him be glory in the 
Church, and in Christ Jesus, unto all 
generations, forever and ever. Amen.
