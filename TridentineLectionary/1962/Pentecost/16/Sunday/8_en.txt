In Thy goodness, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, purify and renew our minds by 
these heavenly Sacraments: that, by 
means of them, we may also receive 
help for our bodies, both now and in 
time to come. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
