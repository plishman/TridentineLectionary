At that time, when Jesus went into the 
house of one of the chiefs of the 
Pharisees on the sabbath day to eat 
bread, they watched Him. And behold, 
there was a certain man before Him 
who had the dropsy: and Jesus 
answering, spoke to the lawyers and 
the Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to 
heal on the sabbath day? But they held
their peace: but He taking him, healed 
him, and sent him away. And 
answering them, He said: Which of you
shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit,
and will not immediately draw him out 
on the sabbath day? And they could 
not answer Him these things. And He 
spoke a parable also to them that were
invited, marking how they chose the 
first seats at the table, saying to them: 
When thou art invited to a wedding, sit 
not down in the first place, lest perhaps
one more honorable than thou be 
invited by him; and he that invited thee 
and him come and say to thee: Give 
this man place: and then thou begin 
with shame to take the lowest place. 
But when thou art invited, go, sit down 
in the lowest place: that when he who 
invited thee comes, he may say to 
thee: Friend, go up higher. Then shalt 
thou have glory before them that sit at 
table with thee: because every one that
exalts himself shall be humbled, and 
he that humbled himself shall be 
exalted.
