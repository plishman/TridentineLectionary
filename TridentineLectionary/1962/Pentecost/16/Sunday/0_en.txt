Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I have 
cried to Thee all the day; for Thou, O 
Lord, art sweet and mild, and 
plenteous in mercy to all that call upon 
Thee. (Ps. 85: 1) Bow down Thine ear 
to me, O Lord, and hear me for I am 
needy and poor. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Have mercy on me, O 
Lord, for I have cried to Thee all the 
day; for Thou, O Lord, art sweet and 
mild, and plenteous in mercy to all that 
call upon Thee.
