Brethren, let us not covet evil things, as
they also coveted. Neither become ye 
idolaters, as some of them: as it is 
written, The people sat down to eat and
drink, and rose up to play. Neither let 
us commit fornication, as some of them
committed fornication, and there fell in 
one day three and twenty thousand. 
Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of 
them tempted, and perished by the 
serpents. Neither do you murmur, as 
some of them murmured, and were 
destroyed by the destroyer. Now all 
these things happened to them in 
figure, and they are written for our 
correction, upon whom the ends of the 
world are to come. Wherefore he that 
thinks himself to stand, let him take 
heed lest he fall. Let no temptation take
hold on you, but such as is human: and
God is faithful, Who will not suffer you 
to be tempted above that which you are
able, but will make also with temptation
issue, that you may be able to bear it.
