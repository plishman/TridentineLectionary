Grant to us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
that we may worthily frequent these 
mysteries: for as often as the memorial 
of this Victim is celebrated, the work of 
our redemption is wrought. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
