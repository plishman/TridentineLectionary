Let Thy merciful ears, O Lord, be open 
to the prayers of Thy suppliant people: 
and that Thou may grant their desire to 
those that seek, make them to ask 
such things as shall please Thee. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
