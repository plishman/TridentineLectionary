Behold God is my helper, and the Lord 
is the protector of my soul: turn back 
the evils upon my enemies, and cut 
them off in Thy truth, O Lord my 
protector. (Ps. 53: 3) Save me, O God, 
by Thy Name, and deliver me in Thy 
strength. Glory be to the Father and to 
the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was
in the beginning, is now and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen.
Behold God is my helper, and the Lord 
is the protector of my soul: turn back 
the evils upon my enemies, and cut 
them off in Thy truth, O Lord my 
protector.
