At that time, when Jesus drew near to 
Jerusalem, seeing the city, He wept 
over it, saying: If thou also hadst 
known, and that in this thy day, the 
things that are to thy peace: but now 
they are hidden from thy eyes. For the 
days shall come upon thee, and thine 
enemies shall cast a trench about thee 
on every side, and beat thee flat to the 
ground, and thy children who are in 
thee; and they shall not leave in thee a 
stone upon a stone, because thou hast 
not known the time of thy visitation. And
entering into the temple, He began to 
cast out them that sold therein, and 
them, that bought, saying to them: It is 
written, “My house is the house of 
prayer, but you have made it a den of 
thieves.” And He was teaching daily in 
the temple.
