At that time, Jesus entering into a boat,
passed over the water and came into 
His own city. And behold they brought 
Him one sick of the palsy lying on a 
bed and Jesus seeing their faith, said 
to the sick man of the palsy: Be of good
heart, son, thy sins are forgiven thee. 
And behold some of the Scribes said 
within themselves: He blasphemeth. 
And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said: 
Why do you think evil in your hearts? 
whether is it easier to say: Thy sins are 
forgiven thee or to say: Arise and walk?
But that you may know that the Son of 
Man hath power on earth to forgive sins
(then said He to the man sick of the 
palsy): Arise, take up thy bed, and go 
into thy house. And he rose, and went 
into his house. And the multitude 
seeing it, feared, and glorified God, 
who had given such power to men.
