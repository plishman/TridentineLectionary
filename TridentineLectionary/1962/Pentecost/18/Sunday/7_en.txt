O God, Who, by Thy venerable 
intercourse with us in this Sacrifice, 
dost make us partakers of the one 
Supreme Godhead: grant, we beseech 
Thee, that as we know Thy truth, so we
may follow it by worthy lives. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
