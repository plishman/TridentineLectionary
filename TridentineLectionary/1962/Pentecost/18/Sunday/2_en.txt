Brethren, I give thanks to my God 
always for you, for the grace of God 
that is given you in Jesus Christ, that in
all things you are made rich in Him in 
all utterance and in all knowledge, as 
the testimony of Christ was confirmed 
to you so that nothing is wanting to you 
in any grace, waiting for the 
manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Who will also confirm you into the end 
without crime, in the day of the coming 
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
