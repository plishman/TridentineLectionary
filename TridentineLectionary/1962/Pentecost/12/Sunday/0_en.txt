Incline unto my aid, O God: O Lord, 
make haste to help me: let my enemies
be confounded and ashamed, who 
seek my soul. (Ps. 69: 4) Let them be 
turned backward and blush for shame, 
who desire evils to me. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Incline unto my aid, O 
God: O Lord, make haste to help me: 
let my enemies be confounded and 
ashamed, who seek my soul.
