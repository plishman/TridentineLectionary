O almighty and merciful God, of whose 
gift it comes that Thy faithful people do 
unto Thee worthy and laudable service:
grant unto us, we beseech Thee, that 
we may run without stumbling towards 
the attainment of Thy promises. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
