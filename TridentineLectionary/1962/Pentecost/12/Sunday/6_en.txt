Graciously look upon the sacrifices, we 
beseech Thee, O Lord, which we 
present upon Thine altar: that while 
they obtain pardon for us, they may 
give honor to Thy name. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
