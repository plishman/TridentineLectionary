At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
Blessed are the eyes that see the 
things which you see. For I say to you, 
that many prophets and kings have 
desired to see the things that you see, 
and have not seen them; and to hear 
the things that you hear, and have not 
heard them. And behold a certain 
lawyer stood up, tempting Him, and 
saying: Master, what must I do to 
possess eternal life? But He said to 
him: What is written in the law? how do 
you read it? He answering, said: Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with thy 
whole heart, with thy whole soul, and 
with all thy strength, and with all thy 
mind, and thy neighbor as thyself, And 
He said to him: Thou hast answered 
rightly: this do, and thou shalt live. But 
he, willing to justify himself, said to 
Jesus: And who is my neighbor? And 
Jesus answering, said: A certain man 
went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, 
and fell among robbers, who also 
stripped him, and having wounded him,
went away, leaving him half dead. And 
it chanced that a certain priest went 
down the same way, and seeing him, 
passed by. In like manner also a Levite,
when he was near the place and saw 
him, passed by. But a certain 
Samaritan being on his journey, came 
near him, and seeing him, was moved 
with compassion, and going up to him, 
bound up his wounds, pouring in oil 
and wine, and setting him upon his own
beast, brought him to an inn, and took 
care of him. And the next day he took 
out two pence and gave to the host, 
and said. Take care of him, and 
whatsoever thou shalt spend over and 
above, I, at my return, will repay thee. 
Which of these three, in thine opinion, 
was neighbor to him that fell among 
robbers? But he said: He that showed 
mercy to him. And Jesus said to him: 
Go and do thou in like manner.
