Brethren, Such confidence we have 
through Christ towards God. Not that 
we are sufficient to think anything of 
ourselves, as of ourselves: but our 
sufficiency is from God. Who also hath 
made us fit ministers of the new 
testament, not in the letter, but in the 
spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit 
quickens. Now if the ministration of 
death, engraven with letters upon 
stones, was glorious, so that the 
children of Israel could not steadfastly 
behold the face of Moses, for the glory 
of his countenance which is made void:
how shall not the ministration of the 
spirit be rather in glory? For if the 
ministration of condemnation be glory, 
much more the ministration of justice 
abounds in glory.
