Moses prayed in the sight of the Lord 
his God, and said: Why, O Lord, is 
Thine indignation enkindled against 
Thy people? Let the anger of Thy mind 
cease; remember Abraham, Isaac, and 
Jacob, to whom Thou didst swear to 
give a land flowing with milk and honey.
And the Lord was appeased from doing
the evil which He had spoken of doing 
against His people.
