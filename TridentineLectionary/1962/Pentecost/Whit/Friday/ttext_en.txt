The stational Mass was at one time placed at Sts. John and Paul, but in the 
earlier days was held where the Roman Missal now assigns it, at the Twelve 
Holy Apostles.
The spirit in which the Church solemnizes her feasts is one of intense 
spiritual joy. The Introit today contains, as it were, the summary of a great 
ascetic treatise on Christian joy: "My lips shall rejoice when I shall sing to thee, 
alleluia, alleluia"; this is the inward consequence of this prayer of love.
In the Postcommunion we pray that the sacred mysteries of the altar, which 
we have just celebrated in obedience to Our Lord's command, may become a 
remedy which shall strengthen our weakness in the hard trials that beset us.
