At that time, it came to pass, on a 
certain day that Jesus sat teaching; 
and there were pharisees and doctors 
of the law sitting by that were come out 
of every town of Galilee, and Judea, 
and Jerusalem, and the power of the 
Lord was to heal them. And behold 
men brought in a bed a man who had 
the palsy, and they sought means to 
bring him in, and to lay him before Him;
and when they could not find by what 
way they might bring him in, because of
the multitude, they went up upon the 
roof, and let him down through the tiles 
with his bed into the midst before 
Jesus. And when He saw their faith, He
said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee: 
and the scribes and pharisees began to
think, saying, Who is this who speaketh
blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, 
but God alone? And when Jesus knew 
their thoughts, answering, He saith to 
them, What is it you think in your 
hearts? Which is easier to say? Thy 
sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise 
and walk? But that you may know that 
the Son of man hath power on earth to 
forgive sins(to the crippled man) I say 
to thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go 
into thy house. And immediately rising 
up before them, he took up the bed on 
which he lay and he went away to his 
own house, glorifying God. And all were
astonished, and they glorified God; and
they were filled with fear, saying, We 
have seen wonderful things today.
