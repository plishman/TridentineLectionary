Thus saith the Lord God: O children of 
Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord 
your God; because He hath given you 
a teacher of justice, and He will make 
the early and the latter rain to come 
down to you, as in the beginning: and 
the floors shall be filled with wheat, and
the presses shall overflow with wine 
and oil. And you shall eat in plenty, and 
shall be filled; and you shall praise the 
name of the Lord your God, Who hath 
done wonders with you: and My people
shall not be confounded for ever. And 
you shall know that I am in the midst of 
Israel: and I am the Lord your God, and
there is none besides; and My people 
shall not be confounded forever; said 
the Lord almighty.
