May the sacrifices offered in Thy sight, 
O Lord, be consumed by that divine fire
which the Holy Spirit enkindled in the 
hearts of the disciples of Christ, Thy 
Son. Through the same Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
same Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
