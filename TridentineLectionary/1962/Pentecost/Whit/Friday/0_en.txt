Let my mouth be filled with Thy praise, 
alleluia: that I may sing, alleluia: my lips
shall rejoice, when I shall sing to Thee, 
alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 70: 1-2) In Thee, 
O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be 
put to confusion: deliver me in Thy 
justice, and rescue me. Glory be to the
Father and to the Son and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Let my mouth be filled with
Thy praise, alleluia: that I may sing, 
alleluia: my lips shall rejoice, when I 
shall sing to Thee, alleluia, alleluia.
