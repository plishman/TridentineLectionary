O God, Who didst give the Holy Spirit 
to Thine Apostles, grant to Thy people 
the effect of their pious petition, and, 
as Thou hast given us faith, bestow 
also upon us peace. Through our Lord
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
