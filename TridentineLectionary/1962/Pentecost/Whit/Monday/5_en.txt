At that time, Jesus said to His disciples,
God so loved the world, as to give His 
only-begotten Son; that whosoever 
believeth in Him may not perish, but 
may have life everlasting. For God sent
not His Son into the world to judge the 
world, but that the world may be saved 
by Him. He that believeth in Him is not 
judged, but he that doth not believe is 
already judged, because he believeth 
not in the name of the only-begotten 
Son of God. And this is the judgment: 
because the light is come into the 
world, and men loved darkness rather 
than the light, for their works were evil: 
for every one that doth evil hateth the 
light, and cometh not to the light, that 
his works may not be reproved: but he 
that doth truth cometh to the light, that 
his works may be made manifest, 
because they are done in God.
