Originally, the feast of Pentecost brought to an end in Rome the fifty days of 
the Easter celebrations and introduced the fast of the Ember Days of the 
summer quarter. Afterwards, it became customary to continue the festivity for 
two more days, the Monday and the Tuesday, and, finally, after the time of St. 
Leo the Great, it was extended like the Octave of Easter through the entire 
week. The station was at St. Peter in Chains to avoid having two successive 
stations at the Vatican.
The Gospel shows the immense contrast between God and man. God so 
loves the world that, in order to save it, He sacrifices His only-begotten Son, 
whilst mankind repays this supreme love with utter ingratitude and obstinately 
chooses darkness rather than light.
