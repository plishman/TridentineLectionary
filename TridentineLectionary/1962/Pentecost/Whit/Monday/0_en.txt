He fed them with the fat of wheat, 
alleluia; and filled them with honey out 
of the rock, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 80:
2) Rejoice to God our helper; sing 
aloud to the God of Jacob. Glory be to 
the Father and to the Son and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. He fed them with the fat of 
wheat, alleluia; and filled them with 
honey out of the rock, alleluia, alleluia.
