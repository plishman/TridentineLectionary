In those days, Peter opening his 
mouth, said: Men, brethren, the Lord 
commanded us to preach to the 
people, and to testify that it is He Who 
was appointed by God to be judge of 
the living and of the dead: to Him all 
the prophets give testimony, that 
through His name all receive remission
of sins, who believe in Him. While Peter
was yet speaking these words, the 
Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard 
the word; and the faithful of the 
circumcision, who came with Peter, 
were astonished, for that the grace of 
the Holy Ghost was poured out upon 
the Gentiles also: for they heard them 
speaking with tongues, and magnifying
God. Then Peter answered, Can any 
man forbid water, that these men 
should not be baptized, who have 
received the Holy Ghost as well as 
we? And he commanded them to be 
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ.
