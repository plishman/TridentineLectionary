The station is at St. Mary Major, as is the rule in Rome whenever the 
scrutinies of the candidates for Holy Orders are to take place. The Mass bears a
festival character; at one time the Ember fast was postponed for a few weeks. 
Gregory VII re-established the Ember Days in their proper place, but the festal 
tone of the Office was retained.
The contrast between today's fast and the Gospel lesson in which Jesus 
offers Himself as the bread of eternal life is very opportune. Man does not live 
by bread alone, but has an absolute need of the Word of God, without Whom 
this earthly existence is as a day without light, an empty pretence of life, a 
gloomy image of death.
