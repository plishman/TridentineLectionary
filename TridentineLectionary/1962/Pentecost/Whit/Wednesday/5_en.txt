Lesson from the Acts of the Apostles. In
those days, by the hands of the 
Apostles were many signs and 
wonders wrought among the people. 
And they were all with one accord in 
Solomon's porch. But of the rest no 
man durst join himself with them: but 
the people magnified them. And the 
multitude of men and women that 
believed in the Lord was more 
increased; insomuch that they brought 
forth the sick into the streets, and laid 
them on beds and couches, that when 
Peter came, his shadow at least might 
overshadow any of them, and they 
might be delivered from their infirmities.
And there came also together to 
Jerusalem a multitude out of the 
neighboring cities, bringing sick 
persons, and such as were troubled 
with unclean spirits, who were all 
healed.
