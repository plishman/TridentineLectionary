In those days, Peter standing up with 
the eleven, lifted up his voice and 
spoke to them: Ye men of Judea, and 
all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this 
known to you, and with your ears 
receive my words. For these are not 
drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but 
the third hour of the day; but this is that 
which was spoken of by the prophet 
Joel, And it shall come to pass in the 
last days (saith the Lord), I will pour out
My spirit upon all flesh; and your sons 
and your daughters shall prophesy, and
your young men shall see visions, and 
your old men shall dream dreams. And 
upon My servants indeed, and upon My
handmaids, will I pour out, in those 
days, of My spirit; and they shall 
prophesy. And I will show wonders in 
the heaven above, and signs on the 
earth beneath; blood, and fire, and 
vapor of smoke. The sun shall be 
turned into darkness, and the moon 
into blood, before the great and 
manifest day of the Lord come. And it 
shall come to pass, that whosoever 
shall call upon the name of the Lord, 
shall be saved.
