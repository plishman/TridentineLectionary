At that time, Jesus said to the multitude
of Jews, No man can come to Me, 
except the Father, Who hath sent Me, 
draw him; and I will raise him up in the 
last day. It is written in the prophets, 
And they shall all be taught of God. 
Every one that hath heard of the 
Father, and hath learned, cometh to 
Me. Not that any man hath seen the 
Father, but He who is of God, He hath 
seen the Father. Amen, amen, I say 
unto to you, he that believeth in Me 
hath everlasting life. I am the bread of 
life. Your fathers did eat manna in the 
desert, and are dead. This is the bread 
which cometh down from Heaven, that, 
if any man eat of it, he may not die. I 
am the living bread which came down 
from heaven. If any man eat of this 
bread, he shall live for ever; and the 
bread that I will give, is My flesh for the 
life of the world.
