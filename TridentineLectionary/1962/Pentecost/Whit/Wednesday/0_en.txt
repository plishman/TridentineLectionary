O God, when Thou didst go forth in the 
sight of Thy people, making a passage 
for them, dwelling in the midst of them, 
alleluia; the earth was moved, the 
heavens dropped, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps.
67: 2) Let God arise, and let His 
enemies be scattered: and let them that
hate Him flee from before His face. 
Glory be to the Father and to the Son 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. O God, when
Thou didst go forth in the sight of Thy 
people, making a passage for them, 
dwelling in the midst of them, alleluia; 
the earth was moved, the heavens 
dropped, alleluia, alleluia.
