In those days: the Lord spoke to 
Moses, saying, Speak to the children of
Israel, and thou shalt say to them, 
When you shall have entered into the 
land which I will give you, and shall 
reap your corn, you shall bring sheaves
of ears, the first-fruits of your harvest, 
to the priests, who shall lift up the sheaf
before the Lord, the next day after the 
sabbath, that it may be acceptable for 
you, and shall sanctify it. You shall 
count therefore from the morrow after 
the sabbath, wherein you offered the 
sheaf of the first-fruits, seven full 
weeks, even unto the morrow after the 
seventh week to be expired, that is to 
say, fifty days; and so you shall offer a 
new sacrifice to the Lord, out of all your
dwellings, two loaves of the first-fruits, 
of two tenths of flour leavened, which 
you shall bake for the first-fruits of the 
Lord. And you shall call this day most 
solemn and most holy. You shall do no 
servile work therein. It shall be an 
everlasting ordinance in all your 
dwellings and generations; said the 
Lord almighty.
