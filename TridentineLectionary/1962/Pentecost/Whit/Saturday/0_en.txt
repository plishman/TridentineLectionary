The charity of God is poured forth in 
our hearts, alleluia: by His Spirit 
dwelling within us, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps.
102: 1) Bless the Lord, O my soul; and 
let all that is within me bless His holy 
name. Glory be to the Father and to 
the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was
in the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. The 
charity of God is poured forth in our 
hearts, alleluia: by His Spirit dwelling 
within us, alleluia, alleluia.
