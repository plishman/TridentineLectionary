In the Seventh Century, due to the postponement of the Ember fast, the 
station was at St. Stephen on the Collian Hill; in the Eleventh Century a return 
was made to the primitive place, St. Peter.
Of the five scriptural Lessons which precede the Gloria in excelsis of the 
Mass, some refer to the feast of Pentecost and some to the "fast of the fourth 
month," as St. Leo the Great calls it. In so doing, they represent a kind of 
compromise or fusion of the two rites. Formerly the vigil lasted throughout the 
night, and twelve lessons were read, both in Greek and in Latin; but in
the time of St. Gregory the Great the vigil was shortened and brought within 
more reasonable limits, as we now find it in our present Missal.
Ordinations are held on this day, the various Orders being given as on the 
Ember Saturday in September.
The Paschal Season closes with the Mass. The Sacrifice of the Mass 
fittingly brings the holy season of Easter to an end. Our redemption is now 
accomplished, and the Holy Ghost has come as though to insure its lasting 
efficacy by means of the sacramental character which He impresses on
our souls. This is the special prerogative of the divine Paraclete; His work is 
always definite, complete, and final, like a conclusion which follows inevitably 
and irrevocably on its premises. This is the reason why sins against the Holy 
Ghost can never find pardon; for they are the outcome of the final hardening of 
the soul in utter hatred of Supreme Love.
