Thus saith the Lord God: I will pour out 
My spirit upon all flesh, and your sons 
and your daughters shall prophesy; 
your old men shall dream dreams, and 
your young men shall see visions. 
Moreover, upon My servants and 
handmaids in those days I will pour 
forth My spirit. And I will show wonders 
in Heaven; and in earth blood, and fire, 
and vapor of smoke. The sun shall be 
turned into darkness, and the moon 
into blood, before the great and 
dreadful day of the Lord doth come. 
And it shall come to pass, that every 
one that shall call upon the name of the
Lord shall be saved.
