In those days, Moses said to the 
children of Israel, Hear, O Israel, what I 
command thee this day. When thou art 
come into the land which the Lord Thy 
God will give Thee to possess, and 
hast conquered it, and dwellest in it, 
thou shalt take the first of all thy fruits, 
and put them in a basket, and shalt go 
to the place which the Lord thy God 
shall choose, that His name may be 
invoked there; and thou shalt go to the 
priest that shall be in those days, and 
say to him, I profess this day before the
Lord thy God, Who heard us, and 
looked down upon our affliction, and 
labor, and distress; and brought us out 
of Egypt with a strong hand, and a 
stretched-out arm, with great terror, 
with signs and wonders, and brought 
us into this place, and gave us this land
flowing with milk and honey. And 
therefore now I offer the first fruits of 
the land which the Lord hath given me. 
And thou shalt leave them in the sight 
of the Lord thy God, adoring the Lord 
thy God; and thou shalt feast in all the 
good things which the Lord thy God 
hath given thee.
