In those days, the Lord said to Moses. 
Speak to the children of Israel, and tell 
them: If you live in accordance with My 
precepts and are careful to observe My
commandments, I will give you rain in 
due season, so that the land will bear 
its crops, and the trees their fruit; your 
threshing will last till vintage time, and 
your vintage till the time for sowing, and
you will have food to eat in abundance,
so that you may dwell securely in your 
land. I will establish peace in the land, 
that you may lie down to rest without 
anxiety. I will rid the country of 
ravenous beasts, and keep the sword 
of war from sweeping across your land.
You will rout your enemies and lay 
them low with your sword. Five of you 
will put a hundred of your foes to flight, 
and a hundred of you will chase ten 
thousand of them, till they are cut down
by your sword. I will look with favor 
upon you, and make you fruitful and 
numerous, as I carry out My covenant 
with you. So much of the old crops will 
you have stored up for food that you 
will have to discard them to make room
for the new. I will set My Dwelling 
among you, and will not disdain you. 
Ever present in your midst, I will be 
your God, and you will be My people, 
says the Lord almighty.
