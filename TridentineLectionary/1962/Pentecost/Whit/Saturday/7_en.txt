O God, Who for the healing of souls 
hast ordained the chastisement of our 
bodies by the devout exercise of 
fasting, mercifully grant that we may 
ever be devoted to Thee in both mind 
and body. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
