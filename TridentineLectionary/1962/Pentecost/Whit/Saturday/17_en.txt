Brethren: Being justified by faith, let us 
have peace with God, through Our Lord
Jesus Christ, by Whom also we have 
access through faith into this grace 
wherein we stand, and glory in the 
hope of the glory of the sons of God. 
And not only so, but we glory also in 
tribulations; knowing that tribulation 
worketh patience, and patience trial, 
and trial hope, and hope confoundeth 
not; because the charity of God is 
poured forth in our hearts by the Holy 
Ghost, Who is given to us.
