The Spirit of the Lord hath filled the 
whole earth, alleluia: and that which 
containeth all things hath knowledge of 
the voice, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps.
67: 2) Let God arise, and His enemies 
be scattered, and let them that hate 
Him fly before His face. Glory be to the
Father and to the Son and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. The Spirit of the Lord hath 
filled the whole earth, alleluia: and that 
which containeth all things hath 
knowledge of the voice, alleluia, 
alleluia, alleluia.
