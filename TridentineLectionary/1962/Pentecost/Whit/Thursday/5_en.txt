At that time, Jesus calling together the 
twelve apostles gave them power and 
authority over all devils, and to cure 
diseases. And He sent them to preach 
the kingdom of God, and to heal the 
sick. And He said to them, "Take 
nothing for your journey; neither staff, 
nor scrip, nor bread, nor money: neither
have two coats: and whatsoever house 
you shall enter into, abide there, and 
depart not from thence. And whosoever
will not receive you, when ye go out of 
that city, shake off even the dust of 
your feet for a testimony against them.‚Äù
And going out, they went about through
the towns preaching the gospel, and 
healing everywhere.
