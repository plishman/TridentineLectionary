O God, Who on this day didst teach the
hearts of the faithful by the light of the 
Holy Spirit, grant us in the same Holy 
Spirit ever to delight in those things 
which are right and to rejoice in His 
consolation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
