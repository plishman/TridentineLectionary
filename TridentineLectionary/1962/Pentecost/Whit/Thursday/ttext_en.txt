The Lesson from the Acts describes the joy which filled the people of 
Samaria when the deacon Philip preached the Gospel and worked miracles 
among them. This joy is a gift of the Holy Ghost. If the world nowadays is more 
than ever before restless and eager for amusements, it shows that it has none 
of the joy and consolation of the divine ParacIete, of which it has become 
unworthy by its resistance to His grace.
