In those days, Philip going down to the 
city of Samaria, preached Christ to 
them. And the people with one accord 
were attentive to those things which 
were said by Philip; hearing, and 
seeing the miracles which he did. For 
many of them who had unclean spirits, 
crying with a loud voice went out, and 
many taken with the palsy, and that 
were lame, were healed; and there was
therefore great joy in that city.
