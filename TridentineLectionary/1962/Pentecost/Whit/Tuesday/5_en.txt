At that time, Jesus said to the 
Pharisees: Amen, amen, I say to you, 
he that entereth not by the door into the
sheepfold, but climbeth up another 
way, the same is a thief and a robber. 
But he that entereth in by the door is 
the shepherd of the sheep. To him the 
porter openeth, and the sheep hear his 
voice, and he calleth his own sheep by 
name, and leadeth them out. And when
he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth
before them; and the sheep follow him, 
because they know his voice; but a 
stranger they follow not, but fly from 
him, because they know not the voice 
of strangers. This proverb Jesus spoke
to them: but they understood not what 
He spoke to them. Jesus therefore said
to them again: Amen, amen, I say to 
you, I am the Door of the sheep. All 
others, as many as have come, are 
thieves and robbers; and the sheep 
hear them not. I am the Door. By Me if 
any man enter in, he shall be saved; 
and he shall go in, and go out, and 
shall find pastures. The thief cometh 
not but to steal, and to kill, and to 
destroy. I am come that they may have 
life, and may have it more abundantly.
