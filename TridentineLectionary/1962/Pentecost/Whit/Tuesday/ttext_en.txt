The titular church of St. Anastasia, once the Court church during the 
Byzantine period, is chosen for today's station, instead of the Basilica of St. 
Paul, as the latter is too far out for a procession at this season of the year when 
the weather is too warm.
During the Octave of Pentecost the Church celebrates more especially the 
glories of the grace of the Holy Ghost and His secret work of sanctification in the
Mystical Body of Christ. Thus today she repeats in the verse for the 
Communion the words of Our Lord: "The Spirit who proceedeth from the Father, 
he shall glorify me," and this glorification consists chiefly in our sanctification 
and in the growth of the Kingdom of God in our souls.
