Receive the joy of your glory, alleluia; 
giving thanks to God, alleluia; Who 
hath called you to a heavenly kingdom, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 77: 1) 
Attend, O My people, to My law; incline 
your ears to the words of My mouth. 
Glory be to the Father and to the Son 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Receive the 
joy of your glory, alleluia; giving thanks 
to God, alleluia; Who hath called you to
a heavenly kingdom, alleluia, alleluia, 
alleluia.
