In those days, when the apostles that 
were in Jerusalem had heard that 
Samaria had received the word of God,
they sent unto them Peter and John; 
who, when they were come, prayed for 
them, that they might receive the Holy 
Ghost: for He was not as yet come 
upon any of them; but they were only 
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Then they laid their hands upon them, 
and they received the Holy Ghost.
