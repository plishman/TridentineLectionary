O God, the Protector of those who put 
their trust in Thee, without whom 
nothing is strong, nothing is holy: 
multiply upon us Thy mercy, that with 
Thee as our ruler, and guide, we may 
so pass through things temporal, that 
we may not lose those which are 
eternal. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
