At that time, the publicans and sinners 
drew near unto Jesus to hear Him: and 
the Pharisees and Scribes murmured, 
saying: This man receiveth sinners and
eateth with them. And He spoke to 
them this parable, saying: What man is
there of you that hath a hundred sheep,
and if he shall lose one of them, doth 
he not leave the ninety-nine in the 
desert, and go after that which is lost, 
until he find it? And when he hath found
it, lay it upon his shoulders rejoicing 
and coming home, call together his 
friends and neighbors, saying to them; 
Rejoice with me because I have found 
my sheep that was lost? I say to you 
that even so there shall be joy in 
Heaven upon one sinner that doth 
penance, more than upon ninety-nine 
just who need no penance. Or what 
woman having ten groats, if she lose 
one groat doth not light a candle and 
sweep the house,and seek diligently 
until she find it? And when she hath 
found it, call together her friends and 
neighbors, saying: Rejoice with me 
because I have found the groat which I 
had lost? So I say to you, there shall be
joy before the Angels of God upon one 
sinner doing penance.
