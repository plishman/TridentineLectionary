Look favorably, O Lord, upon the 
offerings of Your prayerful Church and 
grant that those who believe may, in 
continual holiness, partake of the them 
for their salvation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
