Dearly Beloved, Be you humbled under
the mighty hand of God, that He may 
exalt you in the time of visitation; 
casting all your care upon Him, for He 
hath care of you. Be sober and watch, 
because your adversary, the devil, as, 
a roaring lion, goeth about seekinq 
whom he may devour. Whom resist ye,
strong in faith; knowing that the same 
affliction befalls your brethren who are 
in the world. But the God of all grace, 
Who hath called us unto His eternal 
glory in Christ Jesus, after you have 
suffered a little, will Himself perfect you,
and confirm you, and establish you. To 
Him be glory and empire for ever and 
ever, Amen.
