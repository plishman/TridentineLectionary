Grant unto us, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, that through these Sacraments, 
which we have received, whatsoever in
our minds is corrupt, may be cured by 
the gift of their healing power. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
