Be gracious, O Lord, to our humble 
entreaties; and receiving the offerings 
and prayers of Thy people, turn the 
hearts of all of us to Thee: that freed 
from greed of earthly things, we may 
pass on to heavenly desires. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
