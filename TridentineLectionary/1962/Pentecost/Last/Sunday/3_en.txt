Thou hast delivered us, O Lord, from 
them that afflict us: and hast put them 
to shame that hate us. In God we will 
glory all the day: and in Thy Name we 
will give praise for ever. Alleluia, 
alleluia. (Ps. 129: 1, 2) From the 
depths I have cried to Thee, O Lord: 
Lord, hear my prayer. Alleluia.
