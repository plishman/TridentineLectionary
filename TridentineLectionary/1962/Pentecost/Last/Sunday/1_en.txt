Stir up, we beseech Thee, O Lord, the 
wills of Thy faithful people, that they 
more earnestly seeking the fruit of 
divine service, may receive more 
abundantly healing gifts from Thy 
tender mercy. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
