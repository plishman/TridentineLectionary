Brethren, we cease not to pray for you, 
and to beg that you may be filled with 
the knowledge of the will of God, in all 
wisdom and spiritual understanding 
that you may walk worthy of God, in all 
things pleasing, being fruitful in every 
good work, and increasing in the 
knowledge of God; strengthened with 
all might according to the power of His 
glory, in all patience and long suffering 
with joy giving thanks to God the 
Father, who hath made us worthy to be
partakers of the lot of the saints in light:
who hath delivered us from the power 
of darkness, and hath translated us 
into the kingdom of the Son of His love,
in whom we have redemption through 
His Blood, the remission of sins.
