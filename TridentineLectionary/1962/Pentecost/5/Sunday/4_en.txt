At that time Jesus said to His disciples: 
Except your justice abound more than 
that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you 
shall not enter into the kingdom of 
Heaven. You have heard that it was 
said to them of old: Thou shalt not kill 
and whosoever shall kill, shall be in 
danger of the judgment. But I say to 
you, that whosoever is angry with his 
brother, shall be in danger of the 
judgment and whosoever shall say to 
his brother: Raca, shall be in danger of 
the council; and whosoever shall say: 
Thou fool, shalt be in danger of hell fire.
If therefore thou offer thy gift at the 
altar, and there thou remember that thy 
brother hath anything against thee, 
leave there thy offering before the altar,
and go first to be reconciled to thy 
brother; and then coming thou shalt 
offer thy gift.
