Hear, O Lord, my voice with which l 
have cried to Thee: be Thou my helper,
forsake me not, nor do Thou despise 
me, O God, my Savior. (Ps. 26: 1) The 
Lord is my light, and my salvation, 
whom shall I fear? Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Hear, O Lord, my voice 
with which l have cried to Thee: be 
Thou my helper, forsake me not, nor do
Thou despise me, O God, my Savior.
