Dearly beloved: Be ye all of one mind, 
having compassion one of another, 
being lovers of the brotherhood, 
merciful, modest, humble, not 
rendering evil for evil, nor railing for 
railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for 
unto this you are called, that you may 
inherit a blessing. For he that will love 
life and see good days, let him refrain 
his tongue from evil, and his lips that 
they speak no guile. Let him decline 
from evil and do good; let him seek 
after peace, and pursue it: because 
the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, 
and His ears unto their prayers, but the 
countenance of the Lord is against 
them that do evil things, And who is he 
that can hurt you, if you be zealous of 
good? But if also you suffer anything 
for justice' sake, blessed are ye. And 
be not afraid of their fear, and be not 
troubled: but sanctify the Lord Christ in 
your hearts.
