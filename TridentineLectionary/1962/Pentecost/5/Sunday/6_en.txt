Be merciful, O Lord, to our humble 
pleading: and favorably receive these 
offerings of Thy servants and 
handmaidens, that what each of us has
offered to the honor of Thy name, may 
profit us all unto salvation. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
