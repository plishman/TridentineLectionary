O God, Who hast prepared for them 
that love Thee good things unseen: 
pour into our hearts such love towards 
Thee, that, loving Thee in all and 
above all, we may obtain Thy promises,
which exceed all that we can desire. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
