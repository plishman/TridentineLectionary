At that time an Angel of the Lord 
appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: 
Arise, and take the Child and His 
mother, and fly into Egypt, and be there
until I tell thee: for it will come to pass 
that Herod will seek the child to destroy
Him. Who arose, and took the Child 
and His mother by night, and retired 
into Egypt; and He was there until the 
death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled 
which the Lord spoke by the Prophet, 
saying: Out of Egypt have I called My 
Son. Then Herod, perceiving that he 
was deluded by the wise men, was 
exceeding angry, and sending, killed all
the men children that were in 
Bethlehem, and in all the borders 
thereof, from two years old and under, 
according to the time which he had 
diligently inquired of the wise men. 
Then was fulfilled that which was 
spoken by Jeremias the prophet, 
saying: A voice in Rama was heard, 
lamentation and great mourning: 
Rachel bewailing her children, and 
would not be comforted, because they 
are not.
