The relics of the Holy Innocents are said to have been preserved in the 
splendid church of St. Paul's. The station of today, however, was determined by
the delicate feeling of the ancient liturgy that the great solemnities of the year
should always be celebrated by a station at the tombs of SS. Peter and Paul.
At a very early date, the feast of the Holy Innocents, massacred by Herod 
out of fear of Him who was born King of the Jews, was placed near the feast of 
Christmas; hence in Rome this day was observed as a day of mourning and 
penance. Purple vestments were used and the faithful abstained from flesh 
meat and foods cooked in fats. The fast, however, is no longer observed.
The Gospel describes the flight of the Holy Family into Egypt and the 
massacre of the Innocents.
