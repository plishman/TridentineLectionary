Out of the mouth of infants and of 
sucklings, O God, Thou hast perfected 
praise because of Thine enemies. (Ps. 
8: 2) O Lord our God, how admirable is 
Thy name in the whole earth! Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Out of the 
mouth of infants and of sucklings, O 
God, Thou hast perfected praise 
because of Thine enemies.
