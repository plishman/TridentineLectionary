In those days I saw a Lamb standing 
upon Mount Sion, and with Him an 
hundred forty-four thousand, having His
name and the name of His Father 
written on their foreheads. And I heard 
a noise from heaven, as the noise of 
many waters and as the voice of great 
thunder; and the voice which I heard 
was as the voice of harpers, harping on
their harps. And they sung as it were a 
new canticle before the throne, and 
before the four living creatures, and the
ancients: and no man could say the 
canticle, but those hundred forty-four 
thousand who were purchased from the
earth. These are they who were not 
defiled with women, for they are virgins.
These follow the Lamb whithersoever 
He goeth. These were purchased from 
among men, the first-fruits to God and 
to the Lamb: and in their mouth there 
was found no lie: for they are without 
spot before the throne of God.
