O God, Whose praise the martyred 
Innocents did this day proclaim, not by 
speaking, but by dying, destroy in us all
the malice of sinfulness, that our lives 
may also proclaim Thy faith, which our 
tongues profess. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
