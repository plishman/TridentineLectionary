Refreshed with celestial food and drink,
we humbly beseech Thee our God, that
we may be protected by his prayers in 
whose memory we have received 
them. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that as the Savior of the world, 
born on this day, is the Author of our 
heavenly birth, so He may also be to us
the Giver of immortality. Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
