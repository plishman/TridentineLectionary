Receive, O Lord, the gifts which we 
bring to Thee on the solemnity of him 
by whose patronage we trust to be 
delivered. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Sanctify, O Lord, the gifts offered to 
Thee by the new birth of Thine Only-
begotten Son: and cleanse us from the 
stains of our sins. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
