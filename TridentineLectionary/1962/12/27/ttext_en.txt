The feast of St. John is the only feast of an apostle now remaining in the 
Christmas cycle. The station is at St. Mary Major, dedicated to the Savior; this 
basilica seemed the most suitable place for the celebration of the Christmas 
station in honor of St. John to whom the Blessed Virgin had been entrusted, 
both on account of the Savior's crib there preserved, and of the mosaics of 
Sixtus III commemorating the Council of Ephesus, held near the tomb of the 
Evangelist.
The Gradual is drawn from that passage of St. John's Gospel in which 
reference is made to the popular belief, current in the first generation of 
Christians in Asia, that the beloved disciple should not die before the parousia or
last coming of Christ. The advanced age of the Apostle seemed to lend credit to 
this opinion. So St. John, in the very last chapter of his Gospel, desired - as a 
sort of final postscript - to rectify this erroneous interpretation of the Savior's 
words. "So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee?" The words 
were uttered by Our Lord merely as an hypothesis. "So (if) I will"; but in the 
several oral versions of the episode the conditional and hypothetical particle "if" 
was easily passed over; hence St. John felt the necessity of explaining the 
misunderstanding and setting the matter right.
