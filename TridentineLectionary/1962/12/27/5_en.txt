At that time, Jesus said to Peter, Follow
Me. Turning around, Peter saw that 
disciple whom Jesus loved following, 
the one who, at the supper, had leaned
back upon His breast and said: Lord, 
who is he that shall betray Thee? Peter
therefore, seeing him, said to Jesus, 
Lord, and what of this man? Jesus said
to him, So I wish him to remain until I 
come, what is it to thee? Follow thou 
Me. This saying therefore went abroad 
among the brethren, that that disciple 
was not to die. But Jesus had not said: 
He is not to die; but, If I wish him to 
remain until I come, what is it to thee? 
This is the disciple who bears witness 
concerning these things, and who has 
written these things, and we know that 
his witness is true.
