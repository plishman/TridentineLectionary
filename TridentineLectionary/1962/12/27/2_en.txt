He that feareth God, will do good: and 
he that possesseth justice, shall lay 
hold on her, and she will meet him as 
an honorable mother. With the bread 
of life and understanding she will feed 
him, and give him the water of 
wholesome wisdom to drink: and she 
shall be made strong in him, and he 
shall not be moved; and she shall hold 
him fast, and he shall not be 
confounded; and she shall exalt him 
among his neighbors, and in the midst 
of the church she shall open his 
mouth, and shall fill him with the spirit 
of wisdom and understanding, and 
shall clothe him with a robe of glory. 
The Lord our God shall heap upon him 
a treasure of joy and gladness, and 
shall cause him to inherit an everlasting
name.
