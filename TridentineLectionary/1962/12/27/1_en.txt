O Lord, graciously shed light upon Thy 
Church, so that, enlightened by the 
teachings of blessed John, Thine 
Apostle and Evangelist, she may gain 
Thy everlasting rewards. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the new birth in the flesh of 
Thine only-begotten Son may set us 
free, whom the old bondage doth hold 
under the yoke of sin. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
