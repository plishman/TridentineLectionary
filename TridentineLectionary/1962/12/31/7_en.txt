Sanctify, O Lord, the gifts offered to 
Thee by the new birth of Thine only-
begotten Son: and cleanse us from the 
stains of our sins. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(Commemoration of St. Sylvester I)By the offered gifts we beg Thee, O 
Lord, enlighten kindly Thy Church: so 
that Thy flock everywhere may be 
increasing, and the Shepherds, under 
Thy direction, may be pleasing to Thy 
Name. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
