Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the new birth in the flesh of 
Thine only-begotten Son may set us 
free, whom the old bondage doth hold 
under the yoke of sin. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Sylvester I)Eternal Shepherd, direct gently Thy 
flock, and guard it with an everlasting 
protection, by the intercession of 
blessed Sylvester, Thy Sovereign 
Pontiff, whom Thou hast constituted 
Shepherd of the whole Church. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
