Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that as the Savior of the world 
born on this day is the Author of our 
heavenly birth, so He may Himself also 
be to us the Giver of immortality:
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Sylvester I)O Lord, we beseech Thee, graciously 
govern Thy Church, which Thou hast 
fed with a holy meal; so that, directed 
by a mighty wisdom, she may progress 
in liberty, and persist in the integrity of 
faith. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
