The Lord possessed me in the 
beginning of His ways, before He made
anything, from the beginning. I was set 
up from eternity, and of old, before the 
earth was made. The depths were not 
as yet, and I was already conceived; 
neither had the fountains of waters as 
yet sprung out; the mountains with their
huge bulk had not as yet been 
established: before the hills I was 
brought forth; He had not yet made the 
earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of 
the world. When He prepared the 
heavens, I was there; when with a 
certain law and compass He enclosed 
the depths; when He established the 
sky above, and poised the fountains of 
waters; when He compassed the sea 
with its bounds, and set a law to the 
waters that they should not pass their 
limits; when He balanced the 
foundations of the earth; I was with 
Him, forming all things, and was 
delighted every day, playing before Him
at all times, playing in the world: and 
my delight is to be with the children of 
men. Now therefore, ye children, hear 
me: blessed are they that keep my 
ways. Hear instruction, and be wise, 
and refuse it not. Blessed is the man 
that heareth me, and that watcheth 
daily at my gates, and waiteth at the 
posts of my doors. He that shall find 
me, shall find life, and shall have 
salvation from the Lord.
