May the Sacraments which we have 
received, O Lord, our God, heal in us 
the wounds of that sin, from which 
Thou didst alone preserve the 
Immaculate Conception of Blessed 
Mary. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
May we receive, O Lord, Thy mercy in 
the midst of Thy temple, that we may 
prepare with due honor for the 
approaching feast of our redemption. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
