I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, and my
soul shall be joyful in my God: for He 
hath clothed me with the garments of 
salvation, and with the robe of justice 
He hath covered me, as a bride 
adorned with her jewels. (Ps. 29: 2) I 
will extol Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast 
upheld me: and hast not made my 
enemies to rejoice over me. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. I will greatly 
rejoice in the Lord, and my soul shall 
be joyful in my God: for He hath 
clothed me with the garments of 
salvation, and with the robe of justice 
He hath covered me, as a bride 
adorned with her jewels.
