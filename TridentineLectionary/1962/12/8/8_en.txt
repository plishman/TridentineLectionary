It it truly meet and just, right and for our
salvation, that we always aned 
everywhere give thanks unto Thee, O 
holy Lord, Father almighty, everlasting 
God: and that we should praise and 
bless, and proclaim Thee, in the 
Immaculate Conception of the Blessed 
Mary, ever-Virgin: Who also conceived 
Thine only-begotten Son by the 
overshadowing of the Holy Spirit, and 
the glory of her virginity still abiding, 
gave forth to the world the everlasting 
Light, Jesus Christ our Lord. Through 
whom the Angels praise Thy Majesty, 
the Dominations adore it, the Powers 
tremble: the heavens and the hosts of 
heaven, and the blessed Seraphim, 
together celebrate in exultation. With 
whom, we pray Thee, command that 
our voices of supplication also be 
joined in acknowledging Thee saying:
