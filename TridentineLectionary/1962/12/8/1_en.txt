O God, Who, by the Immaculate 
Conception of the Virgin, didst prepare 
a worthy dwelling-place for Thy Son: 
we beseech Thee, that as by the 
foreseen death of the same Thy Son, 
Thou didst preserve her from all stain, 
so Thou wouldst grant unto us also, 
through her intercession, to come unto 
Thee with clean hearts. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
Stir up Thy power, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord, and come: that from the 
threatening dangers of our sins we 
may deserve to be rescued by Thy 
protection, and to be saved by Thy 
deliverance. Who lives and reigns with 
God the Father in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
