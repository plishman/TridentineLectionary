Receive the saving Victim we offer to 
Thee, O Lord, on the solemn feast of 
the Immaculate Conception of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary: and grant that, as 
we confess that by Thy preventing 
grace she was kept free from every 
stain of sin; so, by her intercession, we 
may be delivered from all our offenses. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
May these holy mysteries, O Lord, 
cleanse us by their powerful virtue and 
make us to come with greater purity to 
Him Who is their source. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
