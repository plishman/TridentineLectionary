At that time: the Angel Gabriel was sent
from God into a city of Galilee, called 
Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a 
man whose name was Joseph, of the 
house of David: and the virgin's name 
was Mary. And the Angel being come 
in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the 
Lord is with thee: blessed art thou 
among women.
