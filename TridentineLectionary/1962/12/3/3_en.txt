The just man shall flourish like the 
palm-tree: he shall grow up like the 
cedar of Libanus in the house of the 
Lord. (91: 3) To show forth Thy mercy 
in the morning, and Thy truth in the 
night. Alleluia, alleluia. (James 1: 12) 
Blessed is the man that endureth 
temptation: for when he hath been 
proved, he shall receive the crown of 
life. Alleluia.
