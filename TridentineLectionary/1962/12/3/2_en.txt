Brethren, With the heart we believe 
unto justice, but with the mouth 
confession is made unto salvation. For 
the Scripture saith: Whosoever 
believeth in Him shall not be 
confounded. For there is no distinction 
of the Jew and the Greek; for the same
is Lord over all, rich unto all that call 
upon Him. For whosoever shall call 
upon the name of the Lord shall be 
saved. How then shall they call on Him 
in Whom they have not believed? or 
how shall they believe Him of Whom 
they have not heard? and how shall 
they hear, without a preacher? and 
how shall they preach, unless they be 
sent? as it is written: How beautiful are
the feet of them that preach the Gospel
of peace, of them that bring glad 
tidings of good things! But all do not 
obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord, 
who hath believed our report? Faith, 
then, cometh by hearing; and hearing 
by the word of Christ. But I say: Have 
they not heard? Yea, verily, their sound 
hath gone forth into all the earth, and 
their words unto the ends of the whole 
world.
