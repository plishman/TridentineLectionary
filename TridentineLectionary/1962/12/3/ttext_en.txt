This great Jesuit missionary, was the apostle of the East Indies, and the first to 
preach the faith of Christ in Japan. He baptized hundreds of thousands of 
pagans. For the love of Jesus and out of a "longing love to help Christ's poor," 
he traveled, barefoot, to the most distant parts, preached the Gospel in more 
than a hundred kingdoms, and islands, brought kings and nations into the fold of
the Church. And then this noble-hearted missionary, this saint mighty in word
and work, gave his great soul to his Master, December 2, 1552.
