I spoke of Thy testimonies before 
kings, and I was not ashamed: I 
meditated also on Thy commandments,
which I loved exceedingly. (Ps. 116: 1-
2) Praise the Lord, all ye nations, and 
praise Him, all ye people: because His
mercy is confirmed upon us and the 
truth of the Lord remaineth forever. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. I spoke of 
Thy testimonies before kings, and I 
was not ashamed: I meditated also on 
Thy commandments, which I loved 
exceedingly.
