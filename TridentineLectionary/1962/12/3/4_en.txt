At that time, Jesus said to His 
disciples: Go ye into the whole world, 
and preach the Gospel to every 
creature. He that believeth and is 
baptized, shall be saved; but he that 
believeth not, shall be condemned. And
these signs shall follow them that 
believe: In My name they shall cast out 
devils; they shall speak with new 
tongues; they shall take up serpents; 
and if they shall drink any deadly thing,
it shall not hurt them; they shall lay 
their hands upon the sick, and they 
shall recover.
