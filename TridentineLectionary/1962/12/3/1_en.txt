O God, Who wast pleased to gather 
into Thy Church the nations of the 
Indies by the preaching and miracles of
blessed Francis: mercifully grant that 
we, who venerate his glorious merits, 
may also imitate the example of his 
virtues. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
