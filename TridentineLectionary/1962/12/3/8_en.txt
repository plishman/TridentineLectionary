We beseech Thee, O almighty God, 
that we, who have partaken of 
heavenly nourishment, may, by the 
intercession of blessed Francis, Thy 
Confessor, be fortified by the same 
against all adverse influences. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
