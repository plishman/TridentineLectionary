Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the offering of our lowliness 
may be both be pleasing to Thee for 
the honor of Thy Saints and may 
likewise purify us in body and soul. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
