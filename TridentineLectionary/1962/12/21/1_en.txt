Grant unto us, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, to glory in the solemn feast of Thy
blessed Apostle Thomas: that we may 
ever both be helped by his patronage, 
and with due devotion follow his faith. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
Incline Thine ear, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, to our petitions: and, by the grace
of Thy visitation, enlighten the darkness
of our minds. Who lives and reigns, 
with God the Father, in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
