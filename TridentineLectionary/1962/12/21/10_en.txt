Be present with us, O merciful God, 
and through the intercession of the 
blessed Apostle Thomas on our behalf, 
mercifully guard Thy Gifts bestowed 
upon us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
We implore, O Lord, Thy mercy: that 
these divine helps may expiate our sins
and prepare us for the approaching 
feast. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
