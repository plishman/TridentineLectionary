Brethren: You are no more strangers 
and foreigners, but you are fellow 
citizens with the Saints, and domestics 
of God: built upon the foundation of the 
Apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ 
Himself being the chief cornerstone. In
Whom all the building being framed 
together, groweth up into a holy temple 
in the Lord. In Whom you also are built
together into a habitation of God in the 
Spirit.
