St. Thomas, called Didymus, that is "the twin," was probably a Galilean of 
lowly condition and a fisherman. He was chosen to be one of the apostles in the
year 31, as can be determined from the mention of his name in the catalogue of 
the apostles in St. Matthew. He is reputed to have been slow of understanding 
and little acquainted with secular learning.
When Jesus was about to go to the neighborhood of Jerusalem in order to 
raise Lazarus from the dead, the other apostles tried to dissuade Him, lest the 
Jews stone Him. But in his enthusiastic love St. Thomas exclaimed, "Let us also
go, that we may die with Him!" Again, it was at the Last Supper that the Saviour
said: "And whither I go you know, and the way you know." To this St. Thomas, 
burning with an ardent desire to follow the Master said, "Lord, we know not 
whither Thou goest; and how can we know the way?" To which Our Lord replied
with the beautiful words, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man 
cometh to the Father but by Me." In the Gospel for today the response of Jesus 
to the doubt which Thomas had expressed concerning his resurrection is 
related, with the answer of Thomas, "My Lord and my God."
St. Thomas is said to have planted the standard of the cross among the 
Medes, Persians, and neighboring nations. He is called the Apostle of India. He 
is said to have been slain for the faith at Calamina in India; and there is a legend
to the effect that he was executed by the sword or by a lance.
