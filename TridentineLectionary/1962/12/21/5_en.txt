At that time: Now Thomas, one of the
twelve, who is called Didymus, was not 
with them when Jesus came. The other
disciples therefore said to him: We 
have seen the Lord. But he said to 
them: Except I shall see in his hands 
the print of the nails, and put my finger 
into the place of the nails, and put my 
hand into his side, I will not believe. 
And after eight days again his disciples 
were within, and Thomas with them. 
Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, 
and stood in the midst, and said: Peace
be to you. Then he saith to Thomas: 
Put in thy finger hither, and see my 
hands; and bring hither thy hand, and 
put it into my side; and be not faithless,
but believing. Thomas answered, and 
said to him: My Lord and my God. 
Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast 
seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: 
blessed are they that have not seen, 
and have believed.
