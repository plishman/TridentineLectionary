We render unto Thee, O Lord, the
bounden duty of our service, humbly 
entreating Thee to guard Thy gifts 
within us by the prayers of the blessed 
Apostle Thomas, on the feast of whose 
blessed martyrdom we offer Thee the 
sacrifice of praise. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
May the sacrifice of our devotion, we
beseech Thee, O Lord, be always 
offered unto Thee: that it may both fulfill
the end for which Thou didst institute 
this sacred mystery, and wonderfully 
work in us Thy salvation. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who lives 
and reigns in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
