Eternal Shepherd, direct gently Thy 
flock, and guard it with an everlasting 
protection, by the intercession of 
blessed Damasus, Sovereign Pontiff, 
whom Thou hast constituted Shepherd 
of the whole Church. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth and 
reigneth with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Stir up our hearts, O Lord, to prepare 
the way of Thine only-begotten Son: 
that through His coming we may attain 
to serve Thee with purified minds. Who
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
