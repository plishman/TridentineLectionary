St. Damasus, by birth a Spaniard, governed the Church from 366 to 384. "The
ancients," according to Alban Butler, "particularly commend his constancy in 
maintaining the purity of our holy faith, the innocence of his manners, his 
Christian humility, his compassion for the poor, his piety in adorning holy places,
especially the tombs of the martyrs, and his singular learning." Much of our 
knowledge about the martyrs is derived from the inscriptions which he 
composed in their praise. He established rules for the liturgical singing of the 
Psalms and decreed that the Gloria Patri should be said at the end of each 
Psalm. At his command St. Jerome translated the New Testament into Latin. 
This Pope also confirmed the second ecumenical council, held at 
Constantinople.
