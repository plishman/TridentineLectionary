By the offered gifts we beg Thee, O 
Lord, enlighten kindly Thy Church: so 
that Thy flock everywhere may be 
increasing, and the Shepherds, under 
Thy direction, may be pleasing to Thy 
name. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
Be appeased, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, by the prayers and sacrifices of 
our humility: and where no pleadings of
merit suffice, do Thou, by Thine aid, 
assist us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who with Thee lives 
and reigns in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
