Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that as the Savior of the world 
born on this day is the Author of our 
heavenly birth, so He may Himself also 
be to us the Giver of immortality:
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever. 
<br>
<i>(For St. Thomas Becket)</i>
May this Communion, O Lord, cleanse 
us from guilt; and, through the 
intercession of blessed Thomas, Thy 
Martyr and Bishop, make us partakers 
of the heavenly remedy. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
