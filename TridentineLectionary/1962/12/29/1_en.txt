Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the new birth in the flesh of 
Thine only-begotten Son may set us 
free, whom the old bondage doth hold 
under the yoke of sin. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
<i>(For St. Thomas Becket)</i>
O God, for the sake of Whose Church 
the glorious Bishop Thomas fell by the 
sword of ungodly men: grant, we 
beseech Thee, that all who implore his 
aid, may obtain the good fruit of their 
petition. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
