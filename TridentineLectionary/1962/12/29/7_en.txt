Sanctify, O Lord, the gifts offered to 
Thee by the new birth of Thine only-
begotten Son: and cleanse us from the 
stains of our sins. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
<br>
<i>(For St. Thomas Becket)</i>
Sanctify, O Lord, the gifts dedicated to 
Thee, and by the intercession of 
blessed Thomas, Thy Martyr and 
Bishop, through them look upon us with
mercy. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
