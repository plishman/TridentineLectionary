O God, who makest us glad with the
yearly expectation of our redemption,
grant that we who now joyfully receive
Thine only-begotten Son as our 
Redeemer, may also without fear 
behold Him coming as our Judge, the 
same our Lord Jesus Christ Thy Son: 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
