This day you shall know that the Lord 
will come, and save us: and in the 
morning you shall see His glory. (Ps. 
23: 1) The earth is the Lord's and the 
fullness thereof, the world, and all they 
that dwell therein. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. This day you shall know 
that the Lord will come, and save us: 
and in the morning you shall see His 
glory.
