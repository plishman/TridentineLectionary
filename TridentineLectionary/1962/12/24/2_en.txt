Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called 
to be an Apostle, separated unto the 
Gospel of God, which He had promised
before by His prophets in the holy 
Scriptures concerning His Son, who 
was made to Him of the seed of David 
according to the flesh:
who was predestinated the Son of God
in power according to the spirit of 
sanctification by the resurrection of our 
Lord Jesus Christ from the dead: by 
whom we have received grace, and 
apostleship for obedience to the faith in
all nations for His name, among whom 
are you also the called of Jesus Christ 
our Lord.
