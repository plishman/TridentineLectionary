(Station at St. Mary Major)
It was only when Our Lord's nativity was celebrated with increasing
solemnity that a special Mass was said on this vigil. The actual solemnity of 
December 25, instead of consisting of two Masses, one of the vigil and the other
of the feast, with a third inserted in commemoration of St. Anastasia, ended by
allowing four Masses, all of them in honor of the Christian mystery - viz., one in 
the evening of December 24 at the beginning of the night Office, one at midnight
at the first cock-crowing, one in the early morning, and one, finally, at the
hour of Terce.
Unlike the other vigils, in which the penitential character and a sense of 
sadness predominate, that of Christmas is full of vivacity and holy joy. This is 
fully in accordance with the nature of the heart of man. After so long a period of 
anxious and painful expectation, the sudden news of our approaching 
deliverance lightens the heart, while a common joy unites us and makes us 
forget for a moment the hard conditions of our life here below.
