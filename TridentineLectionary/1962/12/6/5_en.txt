At that time, Jesus spoke this parable 
to His disciples: A man going into a far 
country called his servants, and 
delivered to them his goods. And to 
one he gave five talents, and to 
another two, and to another one, to 
every one according to his proper 
ability: and immediately he took his 
journey. And he that had received the 
five talents went his way, and traded 
with the same, and gained other five. 
And in like manner he that had 
received the two gained other two. But 
he that had received the one, going his
way, digged into the earth and hid his 
lord's money. But after a long time the 
lord of those servants came and 
reckoned with them. And he that had 
received the five talents coming, 
brought other five talents, saying: Lord,
thou didst deliver to me five talents, 
behold I have gained other five over 
and above. His lord said to him: Well 
done, good and faithful servant, 
because thou hast been faithful over a 
few things, I will place thee over many 
things: enter thou into the joy of thy 
lord. And he also that had received the 
two talents came and said: Lord, thou 
deliveredst two talents to me, behold I 
have gained other two. His lord said to 
him: Well done, good and faithful 
servant, because thou hast been 
faithful over a few things, I will place 
thee over many things: enter thou into 
the joy of thy lord.
