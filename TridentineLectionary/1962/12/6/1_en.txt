O God, Who didst adorn blessed 
Nicholas, the bishop, with miracles 
unnumbered, grant, we beseech Thee, 
that by his merits and prayers we may 
be delivered from the fires of hell. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
Stir up Thy power, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord, and come: that from the 
threatening dangers of our sins we 
may deserve to be rescued by Thy 
protection, and to be saved by Thy 
deliverance. Who lives and reigns with 
God the Father in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
