Sanctify, we beseech Thee, O Lord 
God, these gifts, which we offer on the 
solemnity of Thy holy Bishop Nicholas: 
that through them our lives,
whether in adversity or in prosperity, 
may everywhere be guided aright. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
May these holy mysteries, O Lord, 
cleanse us by their powerful virtue and 
make us to come with greater purity to 
Him Who is their source. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
