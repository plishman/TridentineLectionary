Brethren, remember your superiors, 
who spoke to you the word of God. 
Consider how they ended their lives, 
and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is 
the same yesterday, today, and 
forever. Be not led away by various 
and strange doctrines: for it is best that
the heart be made steadfast by grace; 
not by baits, in which those who 
walked profited not. We have an altar, 
whereof they have no power to eat 
who serve the tabernacle. For the 
bodies of those beasts, whose blood is
brought into the Holies by the High 
Priest for sin, are burned outside the 
camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that He 
might sanctify the people by His own 
blood, suffered without the gate. Let 
us go forth therefore to Him without 
the camp, bearing His reproach: for we
have not here a lasting city, but we 
seek one that is to come. By Him 
therefore let us offer the sacrifice of 
praise always to God, that is to say, 
the fruit of lips confessing to His name.
And do not forget to do good and to 
impart: for by such sacrifices God's 
favor is obtained. Obey your prelates, 
and be subject to them; for they keep 
watch, as having to render an account 
for your souls.
