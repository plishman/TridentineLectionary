St. Nicholas, archbishop of Myra in Asia Minor, from the childlike innocence of 
his own life and his devout care for the young, is looked upon as the patron of 
children. He died in the middle of the fourth century, and seven hundred years 
later his holy relics were translated to Bari in Italy. Because of the power he 
exercised over flames, we pray that through his intercession we may be 
preserved from the flames of hell. He is remembered for the money which he 
threw in a window that three young girls might have a dowry for their marriage. 
Because of this gift his name has become associated with giving and children 
thank Santa Claus (or St. Nicholas) for their presents at Christmastime.
