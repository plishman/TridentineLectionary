(Station at St. Stephen's on the Caelian Hill)
The feast of St. Stephen is one of the oldest in the Liturgy. The Church of St. 
Stephen on the Caelian Hill was finished only under John I (523-26).
In the Collect we pray to God that we may imitate the example of Stephen, not 
only by forgiving our enemies, but by even loving them and asking for them the 
grace of conversion.
The Lesson in the Mass contains the trial of Stephen as preserved in the Acts of
the Apostles, along with the account of his martyrdom. 
Stephen is not only a martyr; he is one of the most striking personages of the 
apostolic age; so much so that the Greeks give him the title of Apostle, and the 
Roman Liturgy places him in the category of the prophets, doctors and masters, 
whose cruel fate is described to us in the Gospel for today.
