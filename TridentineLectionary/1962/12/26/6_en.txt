Receive, O Lord, our gifts, in 
commemoration of Thy Saints: that as 
suffering made them glorious, so our 
devotion may render us innocent. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.

<i>Commemoration of Christmas</i>
Sanctify, O Lord, the gifts offered to 
Thee, by the new birth of Thine Only-
begotten Son: and cleanse us from the 
stains of our sins. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
