In those days: Stephen, full of grace 
and fortitude, did great wonders and 
signs among the people. Now there 
arose some of that which is called the 
synagogue of the Libertines and of the 
Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and 
of them that were of Cilicia and Asia, 
disputing with Stephen: and they were 
not able to resist the wisdom and the 
spirit that spoke. Now, hearing these 
things, they were cut to the heart, and 
they gnashed with their teeth at him. 
But Stephen being full of the Holy 
Spirit, looking up steadfastly to heaven,
saw the glory of God and Jesus 
standing on the right hand of God. And 
he said: Behold, I see the heavens 
opened, and the Son of man standing 
on the right hand of God. And they, 
crying out with a loud voice, stopped 
their ears and with one accord ran 
violently upon him. And casting him 
forth without the city, they stoned him 
and the witnesses laid down their 
garments at the feet of a young man, 
whose name was Saul. And they 
stoned Stephen, invoking and saying: 
Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And 
falling on his knees, he cried with a 
loud voice, saying: Lord, lay not his sin 
to their charge. And when he had said 
this, he fell asleep in the Lord.
