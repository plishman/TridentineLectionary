Grant us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, to 
imitate what we venerate, that we may 
learn to love even our enemies; for we 
celebrate the birth to life everlasting of 
him who knew how to pray even for his 
persecutors to our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son: Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.

<i>Commemoration of Christmas</i>
<br>
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that the new birth in the flesh of 
Thine only-begotten Son may set us 
free, whom the old bondage doth hold 
under the yoke of sin. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
