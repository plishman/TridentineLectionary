May the mysteries we have received, O
Lord, help us, and through the 
intercession of blessed Stephen, Thy 
Martyr, establish us by Thine 
everlasting protection. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.

<i>Commemoration of Christmas</i>
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that as the Savior of the world, 
born on this day, is the Author of our 
heavenly birth, so He may also be to us
the Giver of immortality. Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
