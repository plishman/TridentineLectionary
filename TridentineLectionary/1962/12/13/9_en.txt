Thou hast filled Thy household, O Lord,
with sacred gifts: ever comfort us, we 
beseech Thee, through her 
intercession whose festival we 
celebrate. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

<i>Commemoration of Feria</i>
Filled with the food of spiritual 
nourishment, we humbly entreat Thee, 
O Lord, that by our partaking of this 
mystery, Thou wouldst teach us to 
despise the things of earth, and to love 
those of heaven. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
