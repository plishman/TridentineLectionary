May the offering of Thy consecrated 
people be accepted by Thee, O Lord, 
in honor of Thy saints, by whose merits
it knoweth that it hath received aid in 
time of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

<i>Commemoration of Feria</i>
Be appeased, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, by the prayers and sacrifices of 
our humility: and where no pleadings of
merit suffice, do Thou, by Thine aid, 
assist us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who with Thee lives 
and reigns in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
