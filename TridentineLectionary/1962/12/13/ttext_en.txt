St. Lucy, a native of Syracuse, Sicily, consecrated herself to God from her 
childhood. Her mother did not know of her vow and wished her to marry a 
young pagan. At the tomb of st. Agatha, she prayed for the cure of her mother 
from a serious disease. When this prayer was granted she informed her mother
of her vow, to which her mother then consented. When the young pagan saw 
her distributing her goods among the poor, his anger knew no bounds. He 
accused her before Paschasius, the governor, of being a Christian. She was 
brought before a judge who commanded her to be exposed to temptation in an
evil house. But God watched over her and made her absolutely immovable so 
that no number of guards could carry her to that place. In a similar way He 
preserved hel from the pains of fire and other dreadful torments. Finally she
died in prison of wounds she had received (304). Her name is in the Canon of 
the Mass.
