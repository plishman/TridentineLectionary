Harken unto us, O God, our Savior, 
that as we rejoice in the festival of 
blessed Lucy, Thy virgin and martyr, so
we may be instructed by the affection 
of pious devotion. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.

<i>Commemoration of Feria</i>
Stir up our hearts, O Lord, to prepare 
the way of Thine only-begotten Son: 
that through His coming we may attain 
to serve Thee with purified minds. Who
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
