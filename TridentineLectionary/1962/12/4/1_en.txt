O God, Who didst will that blessed 
Peter Chrysologus, divinely foreshown 
to be a great doctor, should be elected 
to rule and instruct Thy Church, grant, 
we beseech Thee, that we may be 
worthy to have him as our intercessor 
in heaven, whom we have had as a 
teacher of holy living on earth. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
Stir up Thy power, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord, and come: that from the 
threatening dangers of our sins we 
may deserve to be rescued by Thy 
protection, and to be saved by Thy 
deliverance. Who lives and reigns with 
God the Father in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
