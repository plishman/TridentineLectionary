St. Peter, Archbishop of Ravenna in Italy, who died about the year 450, won the 
title of Chrysologus, "golden worded," not only for his eloquence, but because 
his words were good, true, and of priceless worth. God's choice of St. Peter as a
bishop, which was made known in a vision to Pope Sixtus III, is alluded to in the 
Collect of the Mass.
