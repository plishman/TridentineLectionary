A child is born to us, and a Son is given
to us: Whose government is upon His 
shoulder: and His name shall be called 
the Angel of great counsel. (Ps 97: 1) 
Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: 
because He hath done 
wonderful things. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. A child is born to us, and 
a Son is given to us: Whose 
government is upon His shoulder: and 
His name shall be called the Angel of 
great counsel.
