Official Catholic accounts state that the Virgin Mary appeared four times before 
Juan Diego and one more before Juan Diego's uncle. According to these 
accounts the first apparition occurred on the morning of December 9, 1531, 
when a native Mexican peasant named Juan Diego saw a vision of a maiden at 
a place called the Hill of Tepeyac, which would become part of Villa de 
Guadalupe, a suburb of Mexico City. Speaking to Juan Diego in his native 
Nahuatl language (the language of the Aztec empire), the maiden identified 
herself as the Virgin Mary, "mother of the very true deity" and asked for a church
to be built at that site in her honor. At the fourth apparition, she caused and 
image of herself to appear on Juan Diego's tilma (cloak). Pope Pius XII 
accorded her the title “Patroness of the Americas” in 1946.
