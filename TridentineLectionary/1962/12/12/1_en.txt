O God, Who hast willed that, placed as
we are under the especial patronage 
of the most blessed Virgin Mary, we 
should receive an abundant measure 
of unceasing favors: grant to us, Thy 
suppliant people, whose joy
it is this day to honor her upon earth, 
forevermore to be made happy by 
seeing her in heaven. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Stir up our hearts, O Lord, to prepare 
the way of Thine only-begotten Son: 
that through His coming we may attain 
to serve Thee with purified minds. Who
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
