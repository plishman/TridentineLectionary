By Thy gracious mercy, O Lord, and 
the intercession of blessed Mary ever 
Virgin, may this offering be of avail to 
us for welfare and peace now and for 
evermore. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Be appeased, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, by the prayers and sacrifices of 
our humility: and where no pleadings of
merit suffice, do Thou, by Thine aid, 
assist us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who with Thee lives 
and reigns in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
