Dearly beloved, I charge thee, before 
God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge 
the living and the dead, by His coming 
and His kingdom: preach the word: be 
instant in season, out of season: 
reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience 
and doctrine. For there shall be a time 
when they will not endure sound 
doctrine, but according to their own 
desires they will heap to themselves 
teachers, having itching ears, and will 
indeed turn away their hearing from the
truth, but will be turned unto fables. But
be thou vigilant, labor in all things, do 
the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy 
ministry. Be sober. For I am even now 
ready to be sacrificed, and the time of 
my dissolution is at hand. I have fought 
a good fight, I have finished my course,
I have kept the faith. As to the rest, 
there is laid up for me a crown of 
justice, which the Lord, the just Judge, 
will render to me in that day: and not 
only to me, but to them also that love 
his coming.
