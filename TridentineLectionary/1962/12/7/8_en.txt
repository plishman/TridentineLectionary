Almighty, everlasting God, do Thou, by 
the intercession of blessed Ambrose 
Thy Confessor and Bishop, cause the 
gifts that are offered to Thy majesty, to 
benefit us unto everlasting salvation 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
