O God, Who, through the palm of 
martyrdom, didst transfer blessed 
Wenceslaus from an earthly 
principality to heavenly glory, keep us, 
by his prayers, from all adversity, and 
grant us to rejoice in his fellowship. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
