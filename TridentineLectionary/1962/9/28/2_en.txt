The Lord conducted the just through 
the right ways, and showed him the 
kingdom of God, and gave him the 
knowledge of holy things: made him 
honorable in his labors, and 
accomplished his labors. In the deceit 
of them that overreached him, He stood
by him, and made him honorable. He 
kept him safe from his enemies, and 
He defended him from seducers, and 
gave him a strong conflict, that he 
might overcome, and know that wisdom
is mightier than all. He forsook not the 
just when he was sold, but delivered 
him from sinners: He went down with 
him into the pit. And in bands He left 
him not, till He brought him the sceptre 
of the kingdom, and power against 
those that oppressed him: and shewed 
them to be liars that had accused him, 
and the Lord our God gave him 
everlasting glory.
