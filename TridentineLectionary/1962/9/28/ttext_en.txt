St. Wenceslaus, duke of Bohemia, ruled that country during its period of 
conversion to Christianity. His devotion to the Holy Eucharist is mentioned by St.
Alphonsus in his book, Visits to the Blessed Sacrament.
Wenceslaus was in the habit of sowing and reaping with his own hands the 
wheat from which the hosts were to be made, and he used to rise in the night 
even during the coldest seasons to visit the Blessed Sacrament. His virtue was 
the cause of his death, for it aroused the antagonism of his evil-minded mother 
and brother, who caused him to be assassinated September 28, 938.
