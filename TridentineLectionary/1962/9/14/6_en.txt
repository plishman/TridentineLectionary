Being about to be fed with the body 
and blood of Jesus Christ our 
Lord,through Whom the banner of the 
cross was sanctified, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, our God, that as we 
have had the grace to adore it, so we 
may forever enjoy the effect of its 
salutary glory. Through the same Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
