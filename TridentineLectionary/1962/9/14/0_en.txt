But it behooves us to glory in the cross 
of Our Lord Jesus Christ: in Whom is 
our salvation, life, and resurrection; by 
Whom we are saved and delivered. 
(Ps. 66: 2) May God have mercy on us,
and bless us; may He cause the light of
His countenance to shine upon us, and
may He have mercy on us. Glory be to
the Father and to the Son and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. But it behooves us to glory
in the cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ: in
Whom is our salvation, life, and 
resurrection; by Whom we are saved 
and delivered.
