Christ became obedient for us unto 
death: even the death of the cross. For 
which cause also God hath exalted Him
and hath given Him a name which is 
above all names. Alleluia, alleluia. 
Sweet the wood, sweet the nails, sweet
the load that hangs thereon: to bear up 
the King and Lord of Heaven nought 
was worthy save thou. Alleluia.
