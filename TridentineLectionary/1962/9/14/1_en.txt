O God, Who dost gladden us this day 
by the annual solemnity of the 
Exaltation of the Holy Cross: grant, we 
beseech Thee, that, as we have known
its mystery on earth, we may deserve 
in heaven the reward which it had 
purchased. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
