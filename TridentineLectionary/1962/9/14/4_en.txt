At that time: Jesus said to the multitude
of the Jews, Now is the judgment of the
world: now shall the prince of this world
be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from 
the earth, will draw all things to Myself. 
(Now this He said, signifying what 
death He should die.) The multitude 
answered Him, We have heard out of 
the law, that Christ abideth forever: and
how sayest Thou, the Son of man must
be lifted up? Who is the Son of man? 
Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little
while, the light is among you. Walk 
whilst you have the light, that the 
darkness overtake you not. And he that
walketh in darkness knoweth not 
whither he goeth. Whilst you have the 
light, believe in the light; that you may 
be the children of light.
