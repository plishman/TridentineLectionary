Brethren let this mind be in you which 
was also in Jesus Christ: Who being in 
the form of God, thought it not robbery 
to be equal with God; but emptied 
Himself, taking the form of a servant, 
being made in the likeness of men, and
in habit found as a man. He humbled 
Himself, becoming obedient even unto 
death, even to the death of the cross. 
For which cause God also hath exalted 
Him, and hath given Him a name which
is above all names:
(Here all kneel)
that in the name of Jesus every knee 
should bend, of those that are in 
heaven, on earth, and under the earth; 
and that every tongue should confess 
that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory
of God the Father.
