In ancient times, under the name of "the Exaltation," the finding of the Holy 
Cross was celebrated on September 14th in the West, as is still done in the 
East. But when in the Eighth Century the feast of May 3 was instituted, that of 
September 14th was retained as one of thanksgiving for the recovery, a hundred 
years earlier, by the Great Emperor Heraclius, of the inestimable relic, from the 
infidel Chosroes, King of Persia, who had possessed himself of the holy relic 
when pillaging the city and churches of Jerusalem. In the East the finding of the 
Holy Cross by Helena, the mother of Constantine, was celebrated with great 
splendor. Particles of the true Cross, were, in time, brought from Jerusalem to 
many other churches in the East and in the West. These churches sought to 
imitate the solemn ceremonies in use at Jerusalem in order to do homage to the
Holy Cross, the triumphant standard of our salvation.
