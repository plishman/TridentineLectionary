St. Nicholas of Tolentino, in central Italy, received his name because he was
born after his parents had made a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Nicholas of Bari.
He is one of the glories of the Hermits of St. Augustine. His life is remarkable 
because of the great devotion which he showed to the mystery of the Christ. He 
had impressed upon his body the stigmata of Christ. He is represented holding 
a lily, because he was always a model of innocence and purity. His feast dates 
from the time of Sixtus V.
