Hearken, O Lord, unto our 
supplications, which we present to 
Thee on the feast of blessed Nicholas, 
Thy Confessor: that we, who put not 
our trust in our own righteousness, may
be aided by the prayers of him who 
was well-pleasing to Thee. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
