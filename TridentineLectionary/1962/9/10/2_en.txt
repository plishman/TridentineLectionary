Brethren, We are made a spectacle to 
the world, and to angels, and to men. 
We are fools for Christ's sake, but you 
are wise in Christ; we are weak, but 
you are strong; you are honorable, but 
we without honor. Even unto this hour 
we both hunger and thirst, and are 
naked, and are buffeted, and have no 
fixed abode; and we labor, working with
our own hands: we are reviled, and we 
bless; we are persecuted, and we 
suffer it. We are blasphemed, and we 
entreat; we are made as the refuse of 
this world, the offscouring of all even 
until now. I write not these things to 
confound you; but I admonish you as 
my dearest children: in Christ Jesus our
Lord.
