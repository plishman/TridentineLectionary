The just shall flourish like the palm tree:
he shall grow up like the cedar of 
Libanus: planted in the house of the 
Lord, in the courts of the house of our 
God. (Ps. 91: 2) It is good to give 
praise to the Lord: and to sing to Thy 
Name, O Most High. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. The just shall flourish like 
the palm tree: he shall grow up like the 
cedar of Libanus: planted in the house 
of the Lord, in the courts of the house 
of our God.
