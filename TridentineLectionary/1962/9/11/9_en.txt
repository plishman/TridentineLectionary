Let the prayer of Thy blessed martyrs, 
Protus and Hyacinth, we beseech 
Thee, O Lord, bring it to pass that we 
may be purified by Thy holy mysteries 
which we have received. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
