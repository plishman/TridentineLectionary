These holy martyrs, scourged and beheaded, during the persecutions of 
the Third Century, were commemorated by Pope Damasus with the following 
inscription: "The kingdom of heaven holds thee, O Protus, and thither dost thou 
follow him, O valiant Hyacinth, robed in the purple of thy blood. They were 
brothers and were unconquered in spirit. Protus first won his crown, but 
Hyacinth equally deserved the palm."
