At that time, Jesus said to His disciples,
Beware ye of the leaven of the 
Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. There is
nothing covered that shall not be 
revealed: nor hidden, that shall not be 
known. For whatsoever things you 
have spoken in darkness, shall be 
published in the light; and that which 
you have spoken in the ear in 
chambers shall be preached on the 
house-tops. And I say to you, My 
friends, be not afraid of them who kill 
the body, and after that have no more 
that they can do. But I will show you 
Whom you shall fear: fear ye Him Who,
after He hath killed, hath power to cast 
into Hell. Yea, I say to you, fear Him. 
Are not five sparrows sold for two 
farthings and not one of them is 
forgotten before God? Yea, the very 
hairs of your head are all numbered. 
Fear not, therefore: you are of more 
value than many sparrows. And I say to
you, whosoever shall confess Me 
before men, him shall the Son of man 
also confess before the angels of God.
