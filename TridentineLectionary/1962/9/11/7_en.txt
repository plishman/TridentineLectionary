In commemoration of Thy holy martyrs 
Protus and Hyacinth we pay to Thee, O
Lord, the offerings which we owe Thee;
grant, we beseech Thee, that they may 
procure for us the remedy of eternal 
salvation. . Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
