At that time, Jesus spoke this parable 
to His disciples: A certain nobleman 
went into a far country to receive for 
himself a kingdom, and to return. And 
calling his ten servants, he gave them 
ten pounds; and said to them, Trade till 
I come. But his citizens hated him; and 
they sent an embassage after him, 
saying, We will not have this man to 
reign over us. And it came to pass that 
he returned, having received the 
kingdom; and he commanded his 
servants to be called, to whom he had 
given the money, that he might know 
how much every man had gained by 
trading. And the first came, saying, 
Lord, thy pound hath gained ten 
pounds: and he said to him, Well done, 
thou good servant, good servant, 
because thou hast been faithful in a 
little, thou shalt have power over ten 
cities. And the second came, saying, 
Lord, thy pound hath gained five 
pounds: and he said to him, Be thou 
also over five cities. And another came,
saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,
which I have kept laid up in a napkin; 
for I feared thee, because thou art an 
austere man; thou takest up what thou 
didst not lay down, and thou reapest 
that which thou didst not sow. He saith 
to him, Out of thy own mouth I judge 
thee, thou wicked servant. Thou 
knowest that I was an austere man, 
taking up what I laid not down, and 
reaping that which I did not sow: and 
why then didst thou not give my money 
into the bank, that at my coming I might
have exacted it with usury? And he said
to them that stood by, Take the pound 
away from him, and give it to him that 
hath the ten pounds. And they said to 
Him, Lord, he hath ten pounds. But I 
say to you, that to every one that hath 
shall be given, and he shall abound; 
and from him that hath not, even that 
which he hath shall be taken from him.
