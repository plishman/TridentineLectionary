Grant unto Thy Church, we beseech 
Thee, O almighty God, that it may be 
worthy to have for its glorious defender 
in heaven blessed Stephen, Thy 
confessor, whom it had for its champion
while he reigned on earth. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
