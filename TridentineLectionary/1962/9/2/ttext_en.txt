St. Stephen, King of Hungary, introduced Christianity into his native land. 
Pope Sylvester II gave him the privilege of having a cross carried before him like
an archbishop. He did all that an apostle could do for his country. By his 
example and his influence he induced the nobles and the people to embrace the
Catholic Faith; he gave Christian legislation to the kingdom; he founded and 
endowed episcopal sees, built monasteries and established charitable 
institutions, not only in Hungary but even in Constantinople, Jerusalem, 
Ravenna, and Rome.
St. Stephen, seven years before his death, saw his young and most 
innocent son Emerich, an angel of purity and holiness, whom God glorified by 
many miracles, precede him on the way to heaven. He followed him to the tomb 
on August 15, 1034, but Innocent XI appointed his feast to be kept on 
September 2, in memory of the victory which the Christian army won over the 
Turks at Budapest on this day.
