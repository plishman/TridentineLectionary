Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God that we may follow with due 
devotion the faith of blessed Stephen, 
Thy confessor, who, by spreading 
abroad the same faith, merited to go 
from an earthly kingdom into the glory 
of Thy heavenly kingdom. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
