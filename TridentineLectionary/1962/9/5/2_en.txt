Behold a great priest, who in his days 
pleased God, and was found just; and 
in the time of wrath was made a 
reconciliation. There was not any found
like to him, who kept the law of the 
Most High. Therefore by an oath the 
Lord made him increase among his 
people. He gave him the blessing of all 
nations, and confirmed His covenant 
upon his head. He acknowledged him 
in His blessings: He preserved for him 
His mercy: and he found grace before 
the eyes of the Lord. He glorified him in
the sight of kings, and gave him a 
crown of glory. He made an everlasting 
covenant with him; and gave him a 
great priesthood; and made him 
blessed in glory. To execute the office 
of the priesthood and to have praise in 
his name, and to offer to him worthy 
incense for an odor of sweetness.
