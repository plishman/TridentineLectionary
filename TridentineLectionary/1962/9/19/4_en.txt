Alleluia, alleluia. The white-robed army 
of martyrs praiseth Thee, O Lord. 
Alleluia.
At that time: As Jesus was sitting on 
mount Olivet, the disciples came to him
privately, saying: Tell us when shall 
these things be? and what shall be the 
sign of thy coming, and of the 
consummation of the world? And 
Jesus answering, said to them: Take 
heed that no man seduce you: For 
many will come in my name saying, I 
am Christ: and they will seduce many.
And you shall hear of wars and rumors 
of wars. See that ye be not troubled. 
For these things must come to pass, 
but the end is not yet. For nation shall 
rise against nation, and kingdom 
against kingdom; and there shall be 
pestilences, and famines, and 
earthquakes in places: Now all these 
are the beginnings of sorrows. Then 
shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, 
and shall put you to death: and you 
shall be hated by all nations for my 
name's sake. And then shall many be 
scandalized: and shall betray one 
another: and shall hate one another. 
And many false prophets shall rise, and
shall seduce many. And because 
iniquity hath abounded, the charity of 
many shall grow cold. But he that 
shall persevere to the end, he shall be 
saved.
