O God, Who dost gladden us by the 
annual solemnity of Thy holy martyrs, 
Januarius and his companions, 
mercifully grant that we be kindled by 
the example of those in whose merits 
we rejoice. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
