May this communion, O Lord, purge us 
of guilt and, by the intercession of Thy 
holy martyrs, Januarius and his 
companions, make us partakers of the 
heavenly salvation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
