During the persecution under Diocletian St. Januarius, patron of the city of 
Naples and bishop of Beneventum, was beheaded (305 AD) with his deacons 
and some others. In the great church at Naples are preserved some of the 
blood of St. Januarius in two glass phials, and also his head. The blood is 
congealed, but every year up to the present it liquefies when placed near the 
martyr's head. This miracle has been verified both by scientists and by many 
pious and learned persons. Cardinal Schuster, Archbishop of Milan, was able to
observe it closely and, like others who have studied it, was obliged to confess 
that there seems to be no possible natural explanation of this event. It may be 
that in this manner God is pleased to show to the people of Naples that the 
blood of their great Patron is still active and powerful in the sight of the Lord, for
with God there is no past, but all is present and living in His sight.
