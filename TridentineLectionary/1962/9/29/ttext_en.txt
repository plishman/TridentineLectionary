This is the original feast of the leader of the heavenly armies, St. Michael. 
The captain of the heavenly armies, the angel named in the Canon of the Mass, 
held, from early times, the first place in the Liturgy among the other angels. 
Wherefore, many churches dedicated to St. Michael in the Middle Ages were 
simply known as churches "of the holy angel." St. Michael, whose name 
signifies "who is like unto God" cast the evil spirit out of heaven, and overcame 
Satan in the struggle for possession of the body of Moses. God has entrusted 
our defense, in the combat with the devil, to the angels. The reason for this is 
easily understood. The devil is a spirit who has lost none of the powers inherent 
to his nature. In order, therefore, that the struggle should not be unequal, God 
has placed at our side defenders of the same nature as Lucifer, that is to say 
pure spirits, who are, however, greater and more powerful than he is.
(If this feast falls on a Sunday, the 
Sunday is commemorated.)Errors? help@extraordinaryform.org
