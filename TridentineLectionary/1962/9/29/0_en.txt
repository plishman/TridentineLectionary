Bless the Lord, all ye His angels: you 
that are mighty in strength, and execute
His word, harkening to the voice of His 
orders. (Ps. 102: 1) Bless the Lord, O 
my soul: and let all that is within me 
bless His holy name. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Bless the Lord, all ye His 
angels: you that are mighty in strength, 
and execute His word, harkening to the
voice of His orders.
