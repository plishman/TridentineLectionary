All ye angels of the Lord, bless the 
Lord: sing a hymn, and exalt Him 
above all forever, alleluia.
(If this feast falls on a Sunday, the 
Sunday is commemorated.)Relying upon the intercession of 
blessed Michael, Thine archangel, O 
Lord, we Thy suppliants pray that what 
we perform with our lips we may attain 
with our hearts. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
