O God, Who dost in wonderful order 
dispose the ministries of angels and 
men, mercifully grant that our lives be 
fortified by those who continually stand 
in Thy presence and minister before 
Thee in heaven. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
(If this feast falls on a Sunday, the 
Sunday is commemorated.)In those days: God signified the things 
which must shortly come to pass, 
sending by His angel to His servant 
John, who hath given testimony to the 
word of God, and the testimony of 
Jesus Christ, what things soever he 
hath seen. Blessed is he that readeth 
and heareth the words of this prophecy,
and keepeth those things which are 
written in it; for the time is at hand. 
John to the seven churches which are 
in Asia: Grace be unto you and peace 
from Him that is, and that was, and that
is to come; and from the seven spirits 
which are before His throne; and from 
Jesus Christ, Who is the faithful 
witness, the first begotten of the dead, 
and the prince of the kings of the earth 
Who hath loved us, and washed us 
from our sins in His own blood.
