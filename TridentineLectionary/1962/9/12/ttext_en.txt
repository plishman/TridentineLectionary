This feast originally instituted by Innocent XI in memory of the great victory 
won over the Turks before the walls of Vienna (September 13, 1683), was fixed 
for this date under Pope Pius X. Innocent XII had ordered that It should be kept 
on the Sunday within the Octave of the Nativity of Our Lady. Whatever 
interpretation of the name of Mary we may accept, whether it means bitterness, 
the lady of the sea, or beloved of God, it is still the name of our Mother in 
heaven, the name which was first on the lips of the divine Child, the name which
after that of Jesus holds all our hope of salvation. Many saints, especially St. 
Bernard and St. Gabriele del Addolorata, recognize in the most sweet name of 
Mary the virtues and prerogatives which the Doctors of the Church find in the 
name of the Savior, such as light, strength, sweetness and protection. Therefore
the devout Christian desires above all things to pronounce the holy names of 
Jesus and Mary with his last breath before going forth to behold their 
countenances. Pius X granted great indulgences to those who should make
use of this pious invocation.
