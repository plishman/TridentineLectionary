Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that Thy faithful people, who 
rejoice in the name of and protection of 
the most holy Virgin Mary, may by her 
loving intercession be delivered from all
her evils on earth and be found worthy 
to come to everlasting joy in heaven. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
