At that time: And in the sixth month, the
angel Gabriel was sent from God into a
city of Galilee, called Nazareth, To a 
virgin espoused to a man whose name 
was Joseph, of the house of David: and
the virgin's name was Mary. And the 
angel being come in, said unto her: 
Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: 
blessed art thou among women. Who 
having heard, was troubled at his 
saying and thought with herself what 
manner of salutation this should be. 
And the angel said to her: Fear not, 
Mary, for thou hast found grace with 
God. Behold thou shalt conceive in thy 
womb and shalt bring forth a son: and 
thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall
be great and shall be called the Son of 
the Most High. And the Lord God shall 
give unto Him the throne of David His 
father: and He shall reign in the house 
of Jacob for ever. And of His kingdom 
there shall be no end. And Mary said to
the angel: How shall this be done, 
because I know not man? And the 
angel answering, said to her: The Holy 
Ghost shall come upon thee and the 
power of the Most High shall 
overshadow thee. And therefore also 
the Holy which shall be born of thee 
shall be called the Son of God. And 
behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also 
hath conceived a son in her old age: 
and this is the sixth month with her that 
is called barren. Because no word shall
be impossible with God. And Mary said:
Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it 
done to me according to thy word.
