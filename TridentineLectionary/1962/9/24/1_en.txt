O God, Who for the ransoming from 
slavery of the Christians held captive 
by pagans wast pleased, through the 
most glorious mother of Thy Son to 
enrich Thy Church by a new order: 
grant, we beseech Thee, that she, 
whom we piously venerate as the 
founder of so great a work, may, 
through her merits and prayers,
deliver us from all our sins and from the
captivity of the devil. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
