The Order of Our Lady of Ransom was founded in the Thirteenth Century by
St. Peter Nolasco (Jan. 31) and St. Raymond of Pennafort (Jan. 23), aided by 
King James of Aragon. The object of the Order was to redeem Christians held 
in slavery by the Mohammedans. Pope Gregory IX instituted the feast of Our 
Lady of Ransom and afterwards it was extended by Pope Innocent XII to the 
Universal Church.
