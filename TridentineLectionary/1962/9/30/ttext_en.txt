St. Jerome was born in Dalmatia in 329. Even during his life he was 
renowned as a Doctor and Interpreter of Holy Scripture. He defended Catholic 
teaching against many heresies; his chief aim was to be a perfect monk, and, 
before he would consent to be raised to the priesthood, he exacted a promise 
from Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch, that this new dignity should in no wise 
interfere with his monastic vocation.
To him we owe the translation of the Holy Scriptures, the introduction of the 
alleluia chant into the Sunday Mass, the spread of monastic life among the 
aristocracy, and lastly the daily recital of the Divine Office. After important 
services to the Pope of his time, St. Jerome retired to Bethlehem, where he died
September 30, 420.
