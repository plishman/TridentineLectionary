O God, Who didst vouchsafe to provide
for Thy Church blessed Jerome, Thy 
confessor, a great Doctor for the 
expounding of the Sacred Scriptures, 
grant, we beseech Thee, that through 
his merits we may be enabled, by 
Thine assistance, to practice what both 
by word and deed he hath taught us. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who with Thee liveth and reigneth
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, 
forever and ever.
