By Thy heavenly gifts, O Lord, grant us,
we pray, to serve Thee with 
untrammeled minds, that the offerings 
we bring may, by the intercession of 
blessed Jerome, Thy confessor, effect 
our healing and our glory. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth 
and reigneth with Thee in the unity of 
the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
