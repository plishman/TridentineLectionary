Filled with Heavenly nourishment, we 
pray Thee, O Lord, that by the 
intercession of blessed Jerome, Thy 
confessor, we may be found worthy to 
obtain the favor of Thy mercy. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
with Thee liveth and reigneth in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
