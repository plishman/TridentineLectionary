But the just shall live for evermore: and 
their reward is with the Lord, and the 
care of them with the most High. 
Therefore shall they receive a kingdom 
of glory, and a crown of beauty at the 
hand of the Lord: for with his right hand
he will cover them, and with his holy 
arm he will defend them. And his zeal 
will take armor, and he will arm the 
creature for the revenge of his 
enemies. He will put on justice as a 
breastplate, and will take true judgment
instead of a helmet. He will take equity 
for an invincible shield.
