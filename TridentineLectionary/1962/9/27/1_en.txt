Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we who celebrate the feast 
day of Thy holy martyrs, Cosmas and 
Damian, by their intercession may be 
delivered. from all dangers that 
threaten us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
