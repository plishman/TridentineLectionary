At that time, Jesus coming down from 
the mountain stood in a plain place, 
and the company of His disciples, and 
a very great multitude of people from 
all Judea and Jerusalem, and the 
seacoast both of Tyre and Sidon, who 
were come to hear Him, and to be 
healed of their diseases. And they that 
were troubled with unclean spirits were
cured. And all the multitude sought to 
touch Him, for virtue went out from 
Him, and healed all. And He, lifting up 
his eyes on His disciples, said, 
Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the 
kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that 
hunger now, for you shall be filled. 
Blessed are ye that weep now, for you 
shall laugh. Blessed shall you be when
men shall hate you, and when they 
shall separate you, and shall reproach 
you, and cast out your name as evil; 
for the Son of man's sake: be glad in 
that day and rejoice, for behold, your 
reward is great in heaven.
