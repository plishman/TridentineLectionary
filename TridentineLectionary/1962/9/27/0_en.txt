Let the people show forth the wisdom 
of the Saints, and the Church declare 
their praise: and their names shall live 
unto generation and generation. 
(Ecclus. 44: 32, 1) Rejoice in the Lord, 
O ye just: praise becometh the upright. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Let the 
people show forth the wisdom of the 
Saints, and the Church declare their 
praise: and their names shall live unto 
generation and generation.
