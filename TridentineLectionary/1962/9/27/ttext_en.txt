These twin brothers, distinguished themselves as physicians. They gave their 
lives for the Faith at Cyrus in Syria where they were buried. Besides using their 
skill for the healing of diseases they sought to spread the Faith in Christ. After 
many tortures they died about the year 285 in the persecution under Diocletian. 
The fame of their miracles spread over the whole world; many churches were 
erected in their honor at Rome and elsewhere. Their names are mentioned in 
the Canon of the Mass and in the Litany of the Saints.
