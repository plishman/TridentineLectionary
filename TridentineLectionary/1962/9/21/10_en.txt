Having received the sacraments, O 
Lord, we pray Thee, by the intercession
of blessed Matthew, Thine apostle and 
evangelist, that what has been 
celebrated for his glory may profit for 
the healing of our souls. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
