St. Matthew was a Galilean by birth. In the Gospel he humbly relates the 
story of his own conversion. To the glory of an apostle he adds that of an 
evangelist. He wrote his Gospel in Aramaic, and it was afterwards translated 
into Greek. The Aramaic text has perished. This Gospel is a divinely inspired 
work included in Sacred Scripture. He gives the line of ancestors from whom 
Jesus descended as a man, and on this account is represented by the animal 
with a human face in the symbolical vision of Ezekiel.
Little is known of his life; the Fathers in general say that he died in Persia. 
St. Paulinus of Nola asserts that he died amongst the Parthians. When his 
remains were discovered at Vella and brought to the Cathedral of Salerno, Pope
Gregory VII began his journey there, but died on the way, and was buried near 
the tomb of St. Matthew.
