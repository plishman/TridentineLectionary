May the oblation of Thy Church, we 
pray Thee, O Lord, be commended by 
the supplications of Thy blessed 
apostle and evangelist Matthew, by 
whose glorious preaching it is 
instructed. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
