As for the likeness of the faces of the 
four living creatures; there was the face
of a man, and the face of a lion on the 
right side of all the four; and the face of 
an ox on the left side of all the four; and
the face of an eagle over all the four. 
And their faces and their wings were 
stretched upward; two wings of every 
one were joined, and two covered their 
bodies; and every one of them went 
straight forward; whither the impulse of 
the spirit was to go, thither they went, 
and they turned not when they went. 
And as for the likeness of the living 
creatures, their appearance was like 
that of burning coals of fire, and like the
appearance of lamps. This was the 
vision running to and fro in the midst of 
the living creatures, a bright fire, and 
lightning going forth from the fire. And 
the living creatures ran and returned 
like flashes of lightning.
