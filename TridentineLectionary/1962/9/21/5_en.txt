At that time, Jesus saw a man sitting in 
the custom-house, named Matthew; 
and He said to him, Follow Me. And he
rose up, and followed Him. And it came
to pass, as He was sitting at meat in 
the house, behold many publicans and 
sinners came and sat down with Jesus 
and His disciples. And the pharisees 
seeing it, said to His disciples, Why 
doth your master eat with publicans 
and sinners? But Jesus hearing it, said,
They that are in health need not a 
physician: but they that are ill. Go, then,
and learn what this meaneth, I will have
mercy, and not sacrifice. For I am not 
come to call the just, but sinners.
