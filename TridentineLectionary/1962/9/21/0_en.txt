The mouth of the just shall meditate 
wisdom, and his tongue shall speak 
judgment: the law of his God is in his 
heart. (Ps. 36: 1) Be not emulous of 
evil-doers; nor envy them that work 
iniquity. Glory be to the Father and to 
the Son and to the Holy Ghost, as it 
was in the beginning, is now and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. The 
mouth of the just shall meditate 
wisdom, and his tongue shall speak 
judgment: the law of his God is in his 
heart.
