O God, Who didst in many ways 
demonstrate in blessed Francis, Thy 
confessor, the mysteries of the cross, 
grant us, we beseech Thee, ever to 
follow the examples of his devotion 
and to be fortified by constant 
meditation upon the same cross. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
