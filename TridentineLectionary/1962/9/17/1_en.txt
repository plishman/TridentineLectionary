O Lord, Jesus Christ, Who, when the 
world was growing cold, in order to 
enkindle in our hearts the fire of Thy 
love, didst renew the sacred marks of 
Thy Passion of the body of blessed 
Francis: mercifully grant, that with the 
aid of his merits and prayers we may 
bear our cross, and bring forth worthy 
fruits of penance: Who lives and reigns
with God the Father in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
