While St. Francis of Assisi, in September, 1224, was rapt in meditation on 
Mount Alvernia, Almighty God as a mark of His special favor deigned to impress 
on his hands, feet, and side the Iikeness of the sacred wounds of Christ. Until 
the day of the saint's death blood flowed from these wounds at intervals. Pope 
Sixtus V ordered this feast to be observed by the whole Church. Clement VIII 
suppressed it, because the Church only dedicates special solemnities to the 
mysteries of our redemption; particular favors granted to the saints by God 
directly concern their individual sanctification, and are commemorated when the 
life of each saint is read in the Breviary on the day of his feast. The feast was 
restored, however, by Paul V, and raised to a rank of a double by Clement XIV. 
Its observance is a privilege overstepping the ordinary rules of the Liturgy, 
extended in honor of St. Francis, and not only rare, but also unique. Christ was 
pleased to imprint upon his new apostle, the herald of the Great King, this 
stigmata as His final seal, changing him to His own image and likeness and 
uniting him to Himself on the rood of the Cross.
