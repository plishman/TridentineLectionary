Thus saith the Lord: Loose the bands 
of wickedness, undo the bundles that 
oppress, let them that are broken go 
free, and break asunder every burden. 
Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring 
the needy and the harborless into thy 
house: when thou shalt see one naked,
cover him, and despise not thy own 
flesh. Then shall thy light break forth as
the morning, and thy health shall 
speedily arise, and thy justice shall go 
before thy face, and the glory of the 
Lord shall gather thee up. Then shalt 
thou call, and the Lord shall hear: thou 
shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. 
When thou shalt pour out thy soul to 
the hungry, and shalt satisfy the 
afflicted soul, then shall thy light rise up
in darkness, and thy darkness shall be 
as the noonday.
