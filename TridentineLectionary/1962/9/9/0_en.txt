The Lord hath satisfied the empty soul: 
such as sat in darkness and in the 
shadow of death, being fast bound in 
misery and iron. (Ps. 106: 8) Let the 
mercies of the Lord give glory unto 
Him: and His wondrous works unto the 
children of men. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. The Lord hath satisfied 
the empty soul: such as sat in darkness
and in the shadow of death, being fast 
bound in misery and iron.
