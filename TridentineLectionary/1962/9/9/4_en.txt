At that time a certain lawyer willing to 
justify himself, said to Jesus, 'And who 
is my neighbor?' And Jesus answering 
said, A certain man went down from 
Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among 
robbers, who also stripped him, and 
having wounded him, went away, 
leaving him half dead: and it chanced 
that a certain priest went down the 
same way, and seeing him, passed by. 
In like manner also a Levite, when he 
was near the place and saw him, 
passed by. But a certain Samaritan 
being on his journey, came near him, 
and seeing him, was moved with 
compassion; and going up to him, 
bound up his wounds, pouring in oil 
and wine; and, setting him upon his 
own beast, brought him to an inn, and 
took care of him: and the next day he 
took out two pence, and gave to to the 
host, and said, 'Take care of him, and 
whatsoever thou shalt spend over and 
above, I, at my return, will repay thee.' 
Which of these three, in thy opinion, 
was neighbor to him that fell among 
robbers? But he said, He that showed 
mercy to him. And Jesus said to him, 
Go and do thou in like manner.
