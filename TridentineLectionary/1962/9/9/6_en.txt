May the Victim of love which we offer 
up in this sacrifice be a propitiation for 
us, through Thy mercy, O Lord: and by 
the prayers and merits of blessed Peter
may it be most efficacious and salutary 
in obtaining for us greater patience and
charity. Through the same Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Gorgonius, 
Martyr)May the oblation of our homage, O 
Lord, be pleasing unto Thee, Thy holy 
martyr Gorgonius being our advocate. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
