O God, Who, when about to call the 
enslaved negroes unto the knowledge 
of Thy name, didst strengthen blessed 
Peter with a wondrous charity and 
patience for their help: grant, through 
his intercession, that we, seeking the 
things of Christ Jesus, may love our 
neighbors in deed and in truth. Through
the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Gorgonius, 
Martyr)May Gorgonius, Thy saint, O Lord, 
gladden us by his intercession, and 
make us joyful on his propitious 
festival. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
