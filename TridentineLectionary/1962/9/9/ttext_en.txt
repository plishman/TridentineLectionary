This Jesuit priest was born in Catalonia (Spain) in 1580. He attended the 
University of Barcelona, where he wrote: "I must dedicate myself to the service 
of God until death, on the understanding that I am like a slave." He went as a 
missionary to Cartagena, New Spain, in what is now Colombia. He met slaves 
as they came off the boat and ministered to them, converting thousands to 
Christ. He was canonized by Pope Leo XIII in 1888.
