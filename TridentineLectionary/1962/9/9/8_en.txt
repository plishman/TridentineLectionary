May the salutary effect of Thy loving 
kindness increase in us, O Lord: that, 
refreshed by this heavenly food we 
may, by the intercession of blessed 
Peter, happily obtain the crown of 
everlasting life. Through our Lord Jesus
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
(Commemoration of St. Gorgonius, 
Martyr)May everlasting sweetness be the 
portion of Thy household, O Lord, and 
strengthen it, that through Gorgonius, 
Thy martyr, it may constantly be 
sustained in the sweet odor of Christ, 
Thy Son. Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
