We who have been satisfied with these 
saving Mysteries, beseech Thee, O 
Lord, that we may be aided by the 
prayers of those whose feast we 
celebrate. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
Harken unto our prayers, O Lord, and 
may we be comforted by the continual 
help of Thy holy martyrs, Euphemia, 
Lucy, and Geminianus, whose festival 
we solemnly celebrate. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
