The souls of the just are in the hand of 
God, and the torment of death shall not
touch them. In the sight of the unwise 
they seemed to die: and their departure
was taken for misery: and their going 
away from us, for utter destruction: but 
they are in peace. And though in the 
sight of men they suffered torments, 
their hope is full of immortality. Afflicted 
in few things, in many they shall be well
rewarded: because God hath tried 
them, and found them worthy of 
Himself. As gold in the furnace He hath 
proved them, and as a victim of a 
holocaust He hath received them, and 
in time there shall be respect had to 
them. The just shall shine, and shall 
run to and fro like sparks among the 
reeds. They shall judge nations, and 
rule over people, and their Lord shall 
reign for ever.
