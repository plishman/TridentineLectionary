Be nigh, O Lord, unto our prayers 
which we offer in memory of Thy 
Saints, that we who put not our trust in 
our own righteousness, may be helped 
by the merits of those who were well-
pleasing to Thee. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Graciously look upon the desires of 
Thy people, O Lord, and cause us to 
rejoice in the interceding prayers of 
those whose festival Thou dost permit 
us to celebrate. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
