May the feast of the blessed Martyrs 
and Bishops Cornelius and Cyprian, 
defend us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
and may their venerable prayer 
commend us unto Thee. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
Grant unto our prayers, O Lord, both 
joy and profit, that, as we each,year 
commemorate with devotion the day of 
the suffering of the holy martyrs 
Euphemia, Lucy, and Geminianus, we 
may also follow them in the constancy 
of their faith. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
