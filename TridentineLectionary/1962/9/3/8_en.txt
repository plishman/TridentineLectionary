We beseech Thee, O Lord our God, 
that we who have been replenished 
with strength at the heavenly table may,
by the intercession of Saint Pius, 
Supreme Pontiff, be also steadfast in 
the faith and of one mind through love 
of Thee. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
