At that time, At that time Jesus said to 
Simon Peter: Simon, Son of John, dost
thou love Me more than these do? He 
said to Him, yes, Lord, thou knowest 
that I love Thee. He said to him, Feed 
My lambs. He said to him a second 
time, Simon, son of John, dost thou 
love Me? He said to him, yes, Lord, 
thou knowest that I love Thee. He said 
to him, Feed My lambs. A third time 
He said to him, Simon, son of John, 
dost thou love Me? Peter was grieved 
because He said to him for the third 
time, Dost thou love Me? And he said 
to Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things, 
Thou knowest that I love Thee. He said
to him, Feed My sheep.
