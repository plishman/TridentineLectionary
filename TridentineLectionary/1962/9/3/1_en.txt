O God, who for the defense of the 
Catholic Faith and the restoration of all 
things in Christ didst fill Saint Pius, 
Supreme Pontiff, with heavenly wisdom
and apostolic courage: grant in Thy 
loving kindness that by following his 
teachings and examples we may attain 
eternal rewards. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
