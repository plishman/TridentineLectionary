I have raised up a chosen man from my
people, with my holy oil I have anointed
him so that my hand is always with him 
and my arm strengthens him. (Ps. 88: 
2) The graces of the Lord I will sing 
forever, with my mouth I will make 
known thy faithfulness through all the 
ages. Glory be to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in 
the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be, world without end. Amen. I have 
raised up a chosen man from my 
people, with my holy oil I have anointed
him so that my hand is always with him 
and my arm strengthens him.
