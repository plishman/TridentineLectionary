Born Giuseppe Sarto on June 2, 1835, in Riese, he was made a cardinal by 
Pope Leo XIII in 1893 and succeeded him as Pope in 1903. As Pope he led the
restoration of Gregorian chant, promoted a Thomist approach to theology and 
fought tirelessly against those he labeled as "Modernists" and "Relativists" who 
would deny the existence of absolute truth. At his direction, a commission 
began the drafting of the first universal Code of Canon Law which was 
promulgated by his successor, Benedict XV in 1917. Pius X died on August 20, 
1914, and was canonized on May 29, 1954.
