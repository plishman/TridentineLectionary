Brethren, we had confidence in our 
God to preach to you the gospel of God
amid much anxiety. For our exhortation 
was not from error, nor from impure 
motives, nor from guile. But as 
approved by God to be entrusted with 
the gospel, so we speak not as 
pleasing men, but God, who proves our
hearts. For at no time have we used 
words of flattery, as you know, nor any 
pretext for avarice, God is witness, nor 
have we sought glory from men, neither
from you nor from others. Although as 
the apostles of Christ we could have 
claimed a position of honor among you,
still while in your midst we were as 
children: as if a nurse were cherishing 
her own children, so we in our love for 
you would gladly have imparted to you 
not only the gospel of God, but also our
own souls: because you had become 
most dear to us.
