Graciously accept these our offerings, 
we beseech Thee, O Lord, and through
the intercession of St. Pius, Supreme 
Pontiff, grant that we may treat these 
divine mysteries with unfeigned 
veneration and ever receive them with 
heartfelt faith. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
