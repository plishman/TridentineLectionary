I have proclaimed thy justice in the 
great assembly: lo, I did not restrain my
lips; Lord, thou knowest. I have not 
hidden thy justice within my heart; I 
have declared thy faithfulness and thy 
help. Alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 22: 5-6) 
Thou preparest a table for me, thou 
anointest my head with oil, my cup 
brims over. Alleluia.
