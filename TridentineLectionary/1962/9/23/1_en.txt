Simon Peter, if thou lovest Me, feed My
lambs, feed My sheep. (Ps. 29: 1) I will
extol Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast 
upheld me: and hast not made my 
enemies to rejoice over me. Glory be to
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. Simon Peter, if thou lovest 
Me, feed My lambs, feed My sheep.
Eternal Shepherd, regard graciously 
Thy flock, and keep it with an 
everlasting protection, by the 
intercession of blessed Linus, Thy 
Martyr and) Sovereign Pontiff, whom 
Thou hast constituted shepherd of the 
whole Church. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
