Behold I have given My words in thy 
mouth: lo, I have set thee over the 
nations, and over kingdoms, to root up, 
and to pull down, and to build, and to 
plant.
By the offered gifts we beg Thee, O 
Lord: enlighten kindly Thy Church: so 
that Thy flock everywhere may be 
increasing, and the Shepherds, under 
Thy direction, may be pleasing to Thy 
Name. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
