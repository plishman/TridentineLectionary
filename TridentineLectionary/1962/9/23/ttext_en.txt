St. Linus, the immediate successor of St. Peter, ruled the Church for about 
twelve years. In the year 79 he suffered martyrdom, and was buried alongside 
the Prince of Apostles. His name is in the Canon of the Mass.
The virgin, St. Thecla, was converted by st. Paul while preaching at Iconium.
She left a luxurious home and followed the apostle in his later journeys. She 
suffered many tortures for the Faith but finally passed her life in solitude in 
Isauria, and there died a holy death.
