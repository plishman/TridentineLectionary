Grant, we beseech Thee, O almighty 
God, that we, who venerate the natal 
feast of blessed Thecla, Thy virgin and 
martyr, may rejoice in her annual 
solemnity and make progress by the 
example of so great a faith. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
