St. Cyprian was converted to the Christian Faith by the holy virgin St. 
Justina, and with her suffered martyrdom. They were both beheaded in the year
304 at Nicomedia, the residence of Emperor Diocletian.
Devotion to Sts. Cyprian and Justina was introduced into Rome during the 
Middle Ages, when tradition asserted that their relics were preserved near the 
Lateran Basilica.
