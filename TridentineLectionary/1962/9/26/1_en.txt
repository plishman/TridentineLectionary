May the continual protection of the 
blessed martyrs, Cyprian and Justina, 
comfort us, O Lord; for Thou didst not 
cease to behold with favor those 
Whom Thou hast granted the grace of 
such assistance. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
