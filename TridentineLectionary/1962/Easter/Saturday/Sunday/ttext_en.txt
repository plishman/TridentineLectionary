The conclusion today of the baptismal celebration, the neophytes gather 
again in the Lateran Basilica beside the font in which on Easter Eve they were 
born to newness of life.
Today's stational liturgy seems to be influenced more than ever by the 
thought of purity and innocence, like a loving mother carried away by the 
beauty of her newborn child. On this day in the early Roman Liturgy the Pope 
used to distribute to the people the Agnus Dei of the blessed wax mixed with 
sacred chrism, on which was impressed the image of the Lamb of God. This 
custom, one of great antiquity, tool place during the Mass, while the schola of 
the cantors chanted the invocation Agnus Dei before the Kiss of peace 
preceding the Communion.
The Epistle explains the teaching of St. Peter to the first Christian converts 
about the sublime dignity to which they have been raised by Baptism. The 
Gospel befits the return of the newly baptized to the Lateran Basilica; Peter is 
the pastor whose words have taught the neophytes; John is the co-titular patron 
of the Lateran baptistry, so that it is in his house, as it were, that the station is 
celebrated today.
After eight days Jesus showed Himself to His Apostles saying: "Peace be to 
you." When time is drawing to an end and the last day is at hand, He will appear
once more to His Church, and by the gift of His peace will strengthen her 
against the final persecutions of Antichrist.
