Christians! to the Paschal Victim offer 
your praises.
The Lamb the sheep redeemeth: 
Christ, sinless, reconcileth sinners to 
the Father.
Death and life contended in that conflict
stupendous: 
The Prince of Life, Who died, reigneth 
alive. 
Speak to us, Mary, what thou sawest 
on your way?
"The tomb of Christ who now liveth: 
and likewise the glory of the Risen.
Angels attesting, the shroud and 
napkin resting.
Christ my hope is arisen: to Galilee He 
goeth before you."
We know that Christ is risen truly from 
the dead: have mercy on us, Thou 
Victor King. Amen. Alleluia.
At that time, on the first day of the 
week, Mary Magdalen cometh early, 
when it was yet dark, unto the 
sepulchre; and she saw the stone 
taken away from the sepulchre. She 
ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon 
Peter, and to the other disciple whom 
Jesus loved, and saith to them: They 
have taken away the Lord out of the 
sepulchre, and we know not where 
they have laid him. Peter therefore 
went out, and that other disciple, and 
they came to the sepulchre. And they 
both ran together, and that other 
disciple did outrun Peter, and came 
first to the sepulchre. And when he 
stooped down, he saw the linen cloths 
lying; but yet he went not in. Then 
cometh Simon Peter, following him, 
and went into the sepulchre, and saw 
the linen cloths lying, and the napkin 
that had been about his head, not lying
with the linen cloths, but apart, 
wrapped up into one place. Then that 
other disciple also went in, who came 
first to the sepulchre: and he saw, and 
believed. For as yet they knew not the 
scripture, that he must rise again from 
the dead.
Blessed be he that cometh in the name
Lord. We have blessed you out of the 
house of the Lord. The Lord is God, 
and he hath shone upon us, alleluia, 
alleluia.
Grant us, O Lord, we beseech Thee, 
ever to rejoice in these Paschal 
mysteries, that, by the continued work 
of our redemption we may come to 
endless happiness. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation, at all times to praise 
Thee, O Lord, but more gloriously 
especially at this time above others 
when Christ our Pasch was sacrificed. 
For He is the true Lamb Who hath 
taken away the sins of the world: Who 
by dying hath destroyed our death: and
by rising again hath restored us to life. 
And therefore with Angels and 
Archangels, with Thrones and 
Dominations, and with all the hosts of 
the heavenly army, we sing the hymn of
Thy glory, evermore saying:
