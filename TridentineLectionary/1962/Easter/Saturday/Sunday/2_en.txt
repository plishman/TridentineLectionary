Dearly beloved: Wherefore laying 
away all malice, and all guile, and 
dissimulations, and envies, and all 
detractions, as newborn babes, desire 
the rational milk without guile, that 
thereby you may grow unto salvation; 
if so be you have tasted that the Lord 
is sweet. Unto whom coming, as to a 
living stone, rejected indeed by men, 
but chosen and made honorable by 
God: be you also as living stones built 
up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood,
to offer up spiritual sacrifices, 
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 
Wherefore it is said in the scripture: 
Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner 
stone, elect, precious. And he that 
shall believe in him, shall not be 
confounded. To you therefore that 
believe, he is honor: but to them that 
believe not, the stone which the 
builders rejected, the same is made 
the head of the corner: And a stone of 
stumbling, and a rock of scandal, to 
them who stumble at the word, neither 
do believe, whereunto also they are 
set. But you are a chosen generation, 
a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a 
purchased people: that you may 
declare his virtues, who hath called 
you out of darkness into his marvelous
light: Who in time past were not a 
people: but are now the people of 
God. Who had not obtained mercy; but
now have obtained mercy.
