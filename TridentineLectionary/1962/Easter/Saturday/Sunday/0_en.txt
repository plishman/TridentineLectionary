The Lord brought forth his people with
joy, alleluia, and his chosen with 
gladness, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 4:1) 
Give glory to the Lord, and call upon 
his name: declare his deeds among the
Gentiles. Glory be to the Father, and to
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. The
Lord brought forth his people with joy, 
alleluia, and his chosen with gladness, 
alleluia, alleluia.
