The Epistle explains the teaching of St. Peter to the first Christian converts 
about the sublime dignity to which they have been raised by Baptism. The 
Gospel befits the return of the newly baptized to the Lateran Basilica; Peter is 
the pastor whose words have taught the neophytes; John is the co-titular patron 
of the Lateran baptistry, so that it is in his house, as it were, that the station is 
celebrated today.
