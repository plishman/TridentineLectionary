Today's stational liturgy seems to be influenced more than ever by the 
thought of purity and innocence, like a loving mother carried away by the 
beauty of her newborn child. On this day in the early Roman Liturgy the Pope 
used to distribute to the people the Agnus Dei of the blessed wax mixed with 
sacred chrism, on which was impressed the image of the Lamb of God. This 
custom, one of great antiquity, tool place during the Mass, while the schola of 
the cantors chanted the invocation Agnus Dei before the Kiss of peace 
preceding the Communion.
