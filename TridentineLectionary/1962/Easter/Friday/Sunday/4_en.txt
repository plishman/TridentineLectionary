Christians! to the Paschal Victim offer 
your praises.
The Lamb the sheep redeemeth: 
Christ, sinless, reconcileth sinners to 
the Father.
Death and life contended in that conflict
stupendous: 
The Prince of Life, Who died, reigneth 
alive. 
Speak to us, Mary, what thou sawest 
on your way?
"The tomb of Christ who now liveth: 
and likewise the glory of the Risen.
Angels attesting, the shroud and 
napkin resting.
Christ my hope is arisen: to Galilee He 
goeth before you."
We know that Christ is risen truly from 
the dead: have mercy on us, Thou 
Victor King. Amen. Alleluia.
At that time: the eleven disciples went 
into Galilee, unto the mountain where 
Jesus had appointed them. And seeing
them they adored: but some doubted. 
And Jesus coming, spoke to them, 
saying: All power is given to me in 
heaven and in earth. Going therefore, 
teach ye all nations; baptizing them in 
the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them 
to observe all things whatsoever I have
commanded you: and behold I am with
you all days, even to the consummation
of the world.
This day shall be for a memorial to 
you: alleluia: and you shall keep it a 
feast to the Lord in your generations 
with an everlasting observance, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
In Thy forgiving mercy, O Lord we pray,
accept the sacrifice which we offer, to 
atone for the sins of those who are 
born anew and to hasten the giving of 
thy heavenly help. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation, at all times to praise 
Thee, O Lord, but more gloriously 
especially at this time above others 
when Christ our Pasch was sacrificed. 
For He is the true Lamb Who hath 
taken away the sins of the world: Who 
by dying hath destroyed our death: and
by rising again hath restored us to life. 
And therefore with Angels and 
Archangels, with Thrones and 
Dominations, and with all the hosts of 
the heavenly army, we sing the hymn of
Thy glory, evermore saying:
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
