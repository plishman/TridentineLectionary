The doctrine taught in the lesson taken from 1 Peter is that contained in the 
article of the creed: "He descended into hell." Among the souls in Limbo were 
patriarchs and prophets and some who had paid no heed to the warnings of 
Noe when he predicted the destruction of the world in the flood. The words 
must not be taken to mean that Christ preached in hell in order to convert the 
souIs who had already been condemned for their sin of unbelief; for the state of 
the soul cannot change after death. Christ descended into the abode of the 
dead to announce both to the good and to the wicked the redemption now 
accomplished; to the good for their supreme consolation, to the wicked as a 
further reason for their condemnation.
