The Lord brought them out in hope, 
alleluia, and the sea overwhelmed 
their enemies, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
(Ps. 77: 1) Attend, O my people, to my
law: incline your ears to the words of 
my mouth. Glory be to the Father, and 
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
The Lord brought them out in hope, 
alleluia, and the sea overwhelmed 
their enemies, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
