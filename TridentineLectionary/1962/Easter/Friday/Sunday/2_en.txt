Dearly beloved: Because Christ died 
once for our sins, the just for the 
unjust: that he might offer us to God, 
being put to death indeed in the flesh, 
but enlivened in the spirit. In which also
coming he preached to those spirits 
that were in prison: which had been 
some time incredulous, when they 
waited for the patience of God in the 
days of Noe, when the ark was 
building: wherein a few, that is, eight 
souls, were saved by water. Whereunto
baptism being of the like form, now 
saveth you also: not the putting away 
of the filth of the flesh, but the 
examination of a good conscience 
towards God by the Resurrection of 
Jesus Christ, our Lord, Who is on the 
right hand of God.
