Almighty and eternal God, in the Easter
sacrament Thou instituted the 
covenant, whereby Thou forgavest 
mankind; grant to our souls, that what 
we outwardly profess we may show 
forth in our deeds. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
