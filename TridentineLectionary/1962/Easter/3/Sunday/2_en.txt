Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as 
strangers and pilgrims, to refrain 
yourselves from carnal desires, which 
war against the soul, having your 
conversation good among the Gentiles:
that whereas they speak against you as
evil-doers, they may, by the good works
which they shall behold in you, glorify 
God in the day of visitation. Be ye 
subject therefore to every human 
creature for God's sake: whether it be 
to the king as excelling, or to governors
as sent by him for the punishment of 
evil-doers and for the praise of the 
good: for so is the will of God, that by 
doing well you may put to silence the 
ignorance of foolish men: as free, and 
not as making liberty a cloak for malice,
but as the servants of God. Honor all 
men: love the brotherhood: fear God: 
honor the king. Servants, be subject to 
your masters with all fear, not only to 
the good and gentle, but also to the 
froward. For this is thankworthy before 
God: in Christ Jesus our Lord.
