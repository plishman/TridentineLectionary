At that time. Jesus said to His disciples:
A little while, and now you shall not see
Me: and again a little while, and you 
shall see Me: because I go to the 
Father. Then some of His disciples said
one to another: What is this that He 
saith to us: A little while, and you shall 
not see Me: and again a little while, and
you shall see Me: because I go to the 
Father? They said therefore: What is 
this that He saith, A little while? We 
know not what He speaketh. And Jesus
knew that they had a mind to ask Him. 
And He said to them: Of this do you 
inquire among yourselves, because I 
said: A little while, and you shall not see
Me: and again a little while, and you 
shall see Me? Amen, amen, I say to 
you, that you shall lament and weep, 
but the world shall rejoice: and you 
shall be made sorrowful, but your 
sorrow shall be turned into joy. A 
woman, when she is in labor, hath 
sorrow, because her hour is come: but 
when she hath brought forth the child, 
she remembereth no more the anguish 
for joy that a man is born into the world.
So also you now indeed have sorrow: 
but I will see you again and your heart 
shall rejoice: and your joy no man shall 
take from you.
