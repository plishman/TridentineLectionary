O God, who to those that go astray 
dost show the light of Thy truth, that 
they may return to the path of justice: 
grant that all who are enrolled in the 
Christian faith, may both reject all that 
is hostile to that name, and follow after 
what is fitting to it. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
