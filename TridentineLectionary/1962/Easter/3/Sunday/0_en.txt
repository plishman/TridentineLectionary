Shout with joy to God, all the earth, 
alleluia: sing ye a psalm to His Name, 
alleluia: give glory to His praise, 
alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 65: 3) 
Say unto God: How terrible are Thy 
works, O Lord! In the multitude of Thy 
strength Thine enemies shall lie to 
Thee. Glory be to the Father and to the
Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in 
the beginning, is now and ever shall be,
world without end. Amen. Shout with 
joy to God, all the earth, alleluia: sing 
ye a psalm to His Name, alleluia: give 
glory to His praise, alleluia, alleluia, 
alleluia.
