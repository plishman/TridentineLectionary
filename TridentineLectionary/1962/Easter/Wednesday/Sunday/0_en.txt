Come, ye blessed of My Father, 
receive the kingdom, alleluia: which 
was prepared for you from the 
foundation of the world, alleluia, 
alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 95: 1) Sing ye to 
the Lord a new canticle; sing to the 
Lord all the earth. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. Come, ye blessed of My 
Father, receive the kingdom, alleluia: 
which was prepared for you from the 
foundation of the world, alleluia, 
alleluia, alleluia.
