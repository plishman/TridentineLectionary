O God, Who dost gladden us: with the 
yearly solemnity of the Lord's 
resurrection, grant in Thy loving 
kindness that through the temporal 
feast which we keep we may be worthy
to reach eternal joys. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
