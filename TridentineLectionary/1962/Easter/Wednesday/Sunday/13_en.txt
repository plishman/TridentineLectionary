The Gospel gives the account of the third appearance of the Risen Savior to
the Apostles. On the shores of Lake Tiberias, St. John, the virgin soul among 
the Apostles, sees him first, but Peter, the most ardent and the most impetuous, 
in the vigor of his faith throws himself into the water and is the first to reach the 
divine Master, while the others slowly follow in the boat. The fishes brought by 
St. Peter at the command of Jesus are interpreted to represent the neophytes
baptized on Holy Saturday.
