Station at St. Lawrence. 
Today we honor St. Lawrence, the Cross-bearer of the Roman Church, to
express our gratitude for the favor shown by him to the catechumens in bringing
them to holy Baptism.
The Gospel gives the account of the third appearance of the Risen Savior to
the Apostles. On the shores of Lake Tiberias, St. John, the virgin soul among 
the Apostles, sees him first, but Peter, the most ardent and the most impetuous, 
in the vigor of his faith throws himself into the water and is the first to reach the 
divine Master, while the others slowly follow in the boat. The fishes brought by 
St. Peter at the command of Jesus are interpreted to represent the neophytes
baptized on Holy Saturday.
Throughout the paschal season the Church displays a great veneration for 
the martyrs, of which the first evidence is seen today at the tomb of St. 
Lawrence. The reason of this devotion is that the martyrs have a special claim to
the glory of the Resurrection, since they have participated more closely than 
others in the ignominy of the Cross.
