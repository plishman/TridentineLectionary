Under the high altar of the Church of the Twelve Apostles are preserved the 
relics of the Apostles Philip and James only. But the stational feast is celebrated
in honor of all the Apostles together.
The Lesson from the Acts of the Apostles deals with the conversion of the 
treasurer of Candace, Queen of the Ethiopians by Philip the deacon, not the 
Apostle. The Gospel gives the account of the appearance of the risen Savior to 
Mary Magdalen; this occurred before He showed Himself to the Apostles, but in 
the Liturgy it is put back until today on account of the respect for them. The 
words of Jesus to the Magdalen are very consoling; by the Resurrection, Our 
Lord has linked humanity to Himself by an intimate bond. Jesus is truly our 
Brother, God is in very deed our Father. By the death of Christ we have gained 
far more than we had lost by sin, and it is in this sense that the deacon sings in 
the Easter proclamation: "O happy fault, that was worthy of so great a 
Redeemer."
