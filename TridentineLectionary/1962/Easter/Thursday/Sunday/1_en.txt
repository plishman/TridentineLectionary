O God, Who hast united a diversity of 
the people in the confession of Thy 
name, grant that there may be one faith
in the minds and one piety in the deeds
of those born again in the waters of 
baptism. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
