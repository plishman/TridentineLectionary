Christians! to the Paschal Victim offer 
your praises.
The Lamb the sheep redeemeth: 
Christ, sinless, reconcileth sinners to 
the Father.
Death and life contended in that conflict
stupendous: 
The Prince of Life, Who died, reigneth 
alive. 
Speak to us, Mary, what thou sawest 
on your way?
"The tomb of Christ who now liveth: 
and likewise the glory of the Risen.
Angels attesting, the shroud and 
napkin resting.
Christ my hope is arisen: to Galilee He 
goeth before you."
We know that Christ is risen truly from 
the dead: have mercy on us, Thou 
Victor King. Amen. Alleluia.
At that time, Mary stood at the 
sepulcher without, weeping. Now as
she was weeping, she stooped down, 
and looked into the sepulcher; and she 
saw two angels in white, sitting, one at 
the head and one at the feet, where the
body of Jesus had been laid. They say 
to her: Woman, why weepest thou? 
She saith to them: Because they have 
taken away my Lord, and I know not 
where they have laid Him. When she 
had thus said, she turned her self back,
and saw Jesus standing; and she knew
not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith to 
her: Woman, why weepest thou? 
Whom seekest thou? She thinking it 
was the gardener, saith to Him: Sir, if 
thou hast taken Him hence, tell me 
where thou hast laid Him; and I will 
take Him away. Jesus saith to her: 
Mary. She turning, saith to Him: 
Rabboni (which is to say, Master). 
Jesus saith to her: Do not touch Me; for
I am not yet ascended to My Father: 
but go to My brethren, and say to them,
I ascend to My Father, and to your 
Father; to My God, and your God. Mary
Magdalen cometh and telleth the 
disciples: I have seen the Lord, and 
these things He said to Me.
In the day of your solemnity, saith the
Lord, I will bring you into a land that
floweth with milk and honey, alleluia.
Graciously receive, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord, the gifts of Thy people, that, 
being renewed by the confession of 
Thy name and by baptism, they may 
attain eternal happiness. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation, at all times to praise 
Thee, O Lord, but more gloriously 
especially at this time above others 
when Christ our Pasch was sacrificed. 
For He is the true Lamb Who hath 
taken away the sins of the world: Who 
by dying hath destroyed our death: and
by rising again hath restored us to life. 
And therefore with Angels and 
Archangels, with Thrones and 
Dominations, and with all the hosts of 
the heavenly army, we sing the hymn of
Thy glory, evermore saying:
