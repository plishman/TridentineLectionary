They praised with one accord Thy 
victorious hand, O Lord, alleluia; for 
wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb,
and made the tongues of infants 
eloquent, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 97: 1) 
Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle; for 
He hath done wonderful things. Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. They 
praised with one accord Thy victorious 
hand, O Lord, alleluia; for wisdom 
opened the mouth of the dumb, and 
made the tongues of infants eloquent, 
alleluia, alleluia.
