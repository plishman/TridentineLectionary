He gave them the water of wholesome
wisdom to drink, alleluia; and she shall 
be made strong in them, and shall not 
be moved, alleluia: And she shall exalt 
them forever, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 104:
1) Give glory to the Lord, and call upon
his name: declare his deeds among the
Gentiles. Glory be to the Father, and to
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. He 
gave them the water of wholesome 
wisdom to drink, alleluia; and she shall 
be made strong in them, and shall not 
be moved, alleluia: And she shall exalt 
them forever, alleluia, alleluia.
