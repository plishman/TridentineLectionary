In those days, Paul rising up, and with 
his hand bespeaking silence, said: Ye 
men of Israel, and you that fear God, 
give ear. Men, brethren, children of the
stock of Abraham, and whosoever 
among you fear God, to you the word 
of this salvation is sent. For they that 
inhabited Jerusalem, and the rulers 
thereof, not knowing him, nor the 
voices of the prophets, which are read 
every sabbath, judging him have 
fulfilled them. And finding no cause of 
death in him, they desired of Pilate, that
they might kill him. And when they had 
fulfilled all things that were written of 
him, taking him down from the tree, 
they laid him in a sepulchre. But God 
raised him up from the dead the third 
day: Who was seen for many days, by 
them who came up with him from 
Galilee to Jerusalem, who to this 
present are his witnesses to the 
people. And we declare unto you, that 
the promise which was made to our 
fathers, This same God hath fulfilled it 
to our children, raising up our Lord 
Jesus Christ.
