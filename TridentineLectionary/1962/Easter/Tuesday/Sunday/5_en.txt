Christians! to the Paschal Victim offer 
your praises.
The Lamb the sheep redeemeth: 
Christ, sinless, reconcileth sinners to 
the Father.
Death and life contended in that conflict
stupendous: 
The Prince of Life, Who died, reigneth 
alive. 
Speak to us, Mary, what thou sawest 
on your way?
"The tomb of Christ who now liveth: 
and likewise the glory of the Risen.
Angels attesting, the shroud and 
napkin resting.
Christ my hope is arisen: to Galilee He 
goeth before you."
We know that Christ is risen truly from 
the dead: have mercy on us, Thou 
Victor King. Amen. Alleluia.
At that time Jesus stood in the midst of 
them, and saith to them: Peace be to 
you; it is I, fear not. But they being 
troubled and frightened, supposed that 
they saw a spirit. And he said to them: 
Why are you troubled, and why do 
thoughts arise in your hearts? See my 
hands and feet, that it is I myself; 
handle, and see: for a spirit hath not 
flesh and bones, as you see me to
have. And when he had said this, he
shewed them his hands and feet. But 
while they yet believed not, and 
wondered for joy, he said: Have you 
any thing to eat? And they offered him 
a piece of a broiled fish, and a 
honeycomb. And when he had eaten 
before them, taking the remains, he
gave to them. And he said to them: 
These are the words which I spoke to 
you, while I was yet with you, that all 
things must needs be fulfilled, which 
are written in the law of Moses, and in 
the prophets, and in the psalms, 
concerning me. Then he opened their 
understanding, that they might 
understand the scriptures. And he
said to them: Thus it is written, and 
thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to 
rise again from the dead, the third day: 
And that penance and remission of sins
should be preached in his name, unto 
all nations.
And the Lord thundered from heaven, 
and the highest gave his voice: Then 
the fountains of waters appeared, 
alleluia.
Accept, O Lord we beseech thee, the
prayers with the sacrifices of the 
people, and grant that what we have 
begun at these rites of our piety and 
devotion, we may pass to the glory of 
heaven. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
It is truly meet and just, right and for 
our salvation, at all times to praise 
Thee, O Lord, but more gloriously 
especially at this time above others 
when Christ our Pasch was sacrificed. 
For He is the true Lamb Who hath 
taken away the sins of the world: Who 
by dying hath destroyed our death: and
by rising again hath restored us to life. 
And therefore with Angels and 
Archangels, with Thrones and 
Dominations, and with all the hosts of 
the heavenly army, we sing the hymn of
Thy glory, evermore saying:
