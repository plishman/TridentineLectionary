Station at St. Paul. 
After visiting St. Peter's, it was fitting that the neophytes should at once be
brought to the Doctor of the Gentiles, beside whose tomb they had learned the 
first rudiments of the new law of the Gospel. Therefore in the Lesson from the 
Acts of the Apostles chosen for today, it is Paul who announces to the faithful 
the Resurrection of the Savior as Peter did on Easter Monday.
The Gospel from St. Luke describes the first appearance of Jesus to the 
Apostles. As the Resurrection of Our Lord is the central tenet of the Christian 
faith, so the Divine Wisdom, in order to take away all excuse for the unbelief of 
the synagogue, willed that the miracle should be proved beyond all possibility of 
doubt.
In the Collect, with solemn simple words, a rule of life is set forth today 
surpassing the heights to which any mere human mind could rise. The Church 
prays that God may grant to the baptized the realization of all which Baptism 
means, inasmuch as it communicates the very life of Jesus Christ HimseIf. 
In the Postcommunion the Church teaches that there are two kinds of 
Communion, the sacramental and the spirituaI. By the first we partake actually 
of the body and blood of Christ; by the second we live by the spirit of the 
Eucharist. As the sacramental Communion can be received only at certain 
times and in certain places, Our Lord unites the soul so intimately to Himself in 
the Holy Eucharist that it lives by His spirit and breathes in unison with His 
heart. Such, in the highest sense, is spiritual Communion.
