The Gospel from St. Luke describes the first appearance of Jesus to the 
Apostles. As the Resurrection of Our Lord is the central tenet of the Christian 
faith, so the Divine Wisdom, in order to take away all excuse for the unbelief of 
the synagogue, willed that the miracle should be proved beyond all possibility of 
doubt.
