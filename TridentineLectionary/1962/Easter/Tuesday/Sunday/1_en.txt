O God, Who art ever multiplying the 
children of thy Church, grant unto the 
same thy servants that they may hold 
fast in their lives the mystery which 
they have received by faith. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
