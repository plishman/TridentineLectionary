O God, who dost illuminate this most 
holy night by the glory of the Lord's 
Resurrection, preserve in the new 
children of Thy family the spirit of 
adoption which Thou hast given; that 
renewed in body and mind, they may 
render to Thee a pure service. 
Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, our Lord, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
