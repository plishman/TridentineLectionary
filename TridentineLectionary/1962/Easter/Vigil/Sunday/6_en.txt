Communicating, and keeping this most 
holy night of the Resurrection of our 
Lord Jesus Christ according to the 
flesh; and also reverencing the 
memory, first, of the glorious Mary, ever
Virgin, Mother of the same our God and
Lord Jesus Christ: as also of the 
blessed Joseph, her Spouse, and of 
the blessed Apostles and Martyrs Peter
and Paul, Andrew, James, John, 
Thomas, James, Philip, Bartholomew, 
Matthew, Simon, and Thaddeus; Linus, 
Cletus, Clement, Xystus, Cornelius, 
Cyprian, Lawrence, Chrysogonus, John
and Paul, Cosmas and Damian, and of 
all Thy Saints, through whose merits 
and prayers, grant that we may in all 
things be defended by the help of Thy 
protection. Through the same Christ 
our Lord. Amen.
