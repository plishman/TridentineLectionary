Accept, we beseech Thee, O Lord, the 
prayers of Thy people together with the
sacrifice they offer: that what has 
begun by the Paschal Mysteries, may 
by Thine arrangement result in our 
eternal healing. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
