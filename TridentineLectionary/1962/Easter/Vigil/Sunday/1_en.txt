Brethren, if you be risen with Christ, 
seek the things that are above, where 
Christ is sitting at the right hand of God:
mind the things that are above, not the 
things that are upon the earth. For you 
are dead, and your life is hid with Christ
in God. When Christ should appear, 
who is your life, then you also shall 
appear with Him in glory.
