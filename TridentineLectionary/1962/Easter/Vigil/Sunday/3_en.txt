And in the end of the Sabbath, when it 
began to dawn toward the first day of 
the week, came Mary Magdalen and 
the other Mary to see the sepulchre. 
And behold there was a great 
earthquake. For an Angel of the Lord 
descended from heaven, and coming, 
rolled back the stone and sat upon it: 
and his countenance was as lightening 
and his raiment as snow. And for fear of
him the guards were struck with terror 
and became as dead men. And the 
Angel answering, said to the women: 
Fear not you: for I know that you seek 
Jesus who was crucified: He is not 
here: for He is risen, as He said. Come 
and see the place where the Lord was 
laid. And going quickly, tell ye His 
disciples that He is risen: and behold 
He will go before you into Galilee: there
you shall see Him. Lo, I have foretold it 
to you.
