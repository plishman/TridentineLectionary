Blessed â˜© be the Lord God of Israel: 
because He hath visited and wrought 
the redemption of His people.
And hath raised up a horn of salvation 
to us, in the house of David His 
servant.
As He spoke by the mouth of His holy 
prophets, who are from the beginning. 
Salvation from our enemies and from 
the hand of all that hate us.
To perform mercy to our fathers and to 
remember His holy testament.
The oath, which He swore to Abraham 
father, that He would grant to us,
That, being delivered from the hand of 
our enemies, we may serve Him 
without fear, 
In holiness and justice before Him all 
our days. 
And thou, child, shall be called the 
prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt 
go before the face of the Lord to 
prepare His ways,
To give knowledge of salvation to His 
people unto the remission of their sins.
Through the bowels of the mercy of our
God, in which the Orient from on high
hath visited us,
To enlighten them that sit in darkness 
and in the shadow of death, to direct 
our feet into the way of peace.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and 
ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen.

And very early in the morning, the first
