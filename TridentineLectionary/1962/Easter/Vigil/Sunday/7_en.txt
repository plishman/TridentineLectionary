We therefore beseech Thee, O Lord, 
graciously to accept this oblation of our 
service, as also of Thy whole family, 
which we make unto Thee on behalf of 
these whom Thou hast vouchsafed to 
bring to a new birth by water and the 
Holy Spirit, granting them remission of 
all their sins: and to dispose our days in
Thy peace, preserve us from final 
damnation and rank us in the number 
of Thine Elect. Through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
Praise ye the Lord in His holy places:
praise ye Him in the firmament of His 
power.
Praise ye Him for His mighty acts:
praise ye Him according to the 
multitude of His greatness.
Praise Him with sound of trumpets:
praise Him with psaltery and harp.
Praise Him with timbrel and choir: 
praise Him with strings and organs.
Praise Him on high sounding cymbals: 
praise Him on cymbals of joy. 
Let every spirit praise the Lord.
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the 
Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
R. As it was in the beginning, is now, 
and ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

And very early in the morning, the first
