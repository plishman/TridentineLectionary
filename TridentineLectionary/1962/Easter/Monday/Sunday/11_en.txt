Among the early Christians the Easter festivities were prolonged for the 
entire week; to no other feast was so much solemnity given. During this week 
Rome kept continuous festival; business transactions were suspended; every 
morning the stational Mass was celebrated at one of the chief basilicas. The 
station at St. Peter's brings to his tomb the newly baptized and bears witness in 
the Mass to the lively faith of the Apostle in whose house today the Roman 
Church is desirous of renewing, as it were, the paschal feast.
