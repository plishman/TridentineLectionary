The Lord has brought thee into a land 
that floweth with milk and honey, 
alleluia: and that the law of the Lord be 
always in thy mouth, alleluia, alleluia.
(Ps. 104: 1) Give glory to the Lord, and
call upon his name: declare his deeds 
among the Gentiles. Glory be to the 
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. The Lord has brought thee
into a land that floweth with milk and 
honey, alleluia: and that the law of the 
Lord be always in thy mouth, alleluia, 
alleluia.
