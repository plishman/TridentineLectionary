Pour forth upon us, O Lord, the spirit of 
Thy charity and may Thy loving-
kindness make us to be of one mind 
those whom thou hast fed fully with 
these Paschal sacraments. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
