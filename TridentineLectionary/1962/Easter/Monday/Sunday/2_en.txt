In those days, Peter standing among 
the people, said: you know the word 
which hath been published through all 
Judea: for it began from Galilee, after 
the baptism which John preached, how 
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with 
the Holy Ghost, and with power, who 
went about doing good, and healing all 
that were oppressed by the devil, for 
God was with him. And we are 
witnesses of all things that he did in the
land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, 
whom they killed, hanging him upon a 
tree. Him God raised up the third day, 
and gave him to be made manifest, not 
to all the people, but to witnesses 
preordained by God, even to us, who 
did eat and drink with him after he 
arose again from the dead. And he 
commanded us to preach to the 
people, and to testify that it is he who 
was appointed by God, to be judge of 
the living and of the dead. To him all 
the prophets give testimony, that by his 
name all receive remission of sins, who
believe in him.
