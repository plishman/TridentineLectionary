O God, Who dost heal the sick world by
the solemn gladness of the Passover, 
continue, we beseech thee, to pour 
forth thine heavenly gifts upon thy 
people, till the same shall bring them 
into perfect liberty, and finally avail 
them unto life everlasting. Through our
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
