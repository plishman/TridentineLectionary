In the Epistle, St. Peter lifts up his voice and proclaims the glory of Christ's 
Resurrection. In the Gospel mention is made of the apparition of Our Lord to 
Peter on the evening of Easter Sunday. The disciples on the way to Emmaus 
knew the Lord in the breaking of the bread. It is probable that this was the 
eucharistic bread; as the Savior at the Last Supper received the Eucharist first 
Himself, in all likelihood He did so again after His Resurrection.
