Among the early Christians the Easter festivities were prolonged for the 
entire week; to no other feast was so much solemnity given. During this week 
Rome kept continuous festival; business transactions were suspended; every 
morning the stational Mass was celebrated at one of the chief basilicas. The 
station at St. Peter's brings to his tomb the newly baptized and bears witness in 
the Mass to the lively faith of the Apostle in whose house today the Roman 
Church is desirous of renewing, as it were, the paschal feast.
In the Epistle, St. Peter lifts up his voice and proclaims the glory of Christ's 
Resurrection. In the Gospel mention is made of the apparition of Our Lord to 
Peter on the evening of Easter Sunday. The disciples on the way to Emmaus 
knew the Lord in the breaking of the bread. It is probable that this was the 
eucharistic bread; as the Savior at the Last Supper received the Eucharist first 
Himself, in all likelihood He did so again after His Resurrection.
