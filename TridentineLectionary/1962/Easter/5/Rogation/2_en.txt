Dearly beloved, confess your sins one 
to another, and pray one for another, 
that you may be saved: for the 
continual prayer of a just man availeth 
much. Elias was a man passible like 
unto us: and with prayer he prayed that
it might not rain upon the earth, and it 
rained not for three years and six 
months. And he prayed again: and the 
heaven gave rain, and the earth 
brought forth her fruit. My brethren, if 
any of you err from the truth and one 
convert him, he must know that he who
causeth a sinner to be converted from 
the error of his way shall save his soul 
from death, and shall cover a multitude 
of sins.
