At that time Jesus said to His disciples: 
Which of you shall have a friend, and 
shall go to him at midnight, and shall 
say to him: Friend, lend me three 
loaves, because a friend of mine is 
come off his journey to me, and I have 
not what to set before him; and he from
within should answer and say: Trouble 
me not, the door is now shut, and my 
children are with me in bed; I cannot 
rise and give thee. Yet if he shall 
continue knocking, I say to you, 
although he will not rise and give him 
because he is his friend, yet because of
his importunity he will rise, and give 
him as many as he needeth. And I say 
to you: Ask, and it shall be given to you;
seek, and you shall find; knock, and it 
shall be opened unto you. For every 
one that asketh receiveth; and he that 
seeketh findeth; and to him that 
knocketh it shall be opened. And which 
of you, if he ask his father bread, will he
give him a stone? Or a fish, will he for a
fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall 
ask an egg, will he reach him a 
scorpion? If you then, being evil, know 
how to give good gifts to your children, 
how much more will your Father from 
heaven give the good Spirit to them 
that ask Him?
