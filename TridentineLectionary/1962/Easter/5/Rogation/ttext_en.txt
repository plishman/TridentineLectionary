(M, T, & W before Ascension)
The triduum of penitential litanies before the feast of the Ascension was first 
instituted at Vienne by St. Mamertus, about the year 470, and was accompanied
by fasting and abstention from servile work. When Rome adopted this custom 
the fast was abolished, and the three days' prayer retained. (rogare means to 
ask, beg, or request â€“ hence also, to petition in prayer)
