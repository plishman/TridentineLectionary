He heard my voice from His holy 
temple, alleluia: and my cry before Him 
came into His ears, alleluia, alleluia. I 
will love Thee, O Lord, my strength: the
Lord is my firmament, my refuge and 
my deliverer. Glory be to the Father, 
and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, 
as it was in the beginning, is now, and 
ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen. He heard my voice from His 
holy temple, alleluia: and my cry before
Him came into His ears, alleluia, 
alleluia.
