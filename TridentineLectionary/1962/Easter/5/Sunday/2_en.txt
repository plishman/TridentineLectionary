Dearly beloved, be ye doers of the 
word and not hearers only, deceiving 
your own selves, For if a man be a 
hearer of the word and not a doer, he 
shall be compared to a man beholding 
his own countenance in a glass: for he 
beheld himself and went his way, and 
presently forgot what manner of man 
he was. But he that hath looked into 
the perfect law of liberty and hath 
continued therein, not becoming a 
forgetful hearer but a doer of the work: 
this man shall be blessed in his deed. 
And if any man think himself to be 
religious, not bridling his tongue but 
deceiving his own heart, this man's 
religion is vain. Religion clean and 
undefiled before God and the Father is 
this: To visit the fatherless and widows 
in their tribulation, and to keep one's 
self unspotted from this world.
