O God, from Whom all good things do 
come, grant unto us, Thy suppliant 
people, that by Thine inspiration, we 
may think what is right, and under Thy 
guidance perform the same. Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reign with Thee in the unity of 
the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
