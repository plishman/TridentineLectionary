At that time Jesus saith to His 
disciples: Amen, amen, I say to you: if 
you ask the Father any thing in My 
name, He will give it to you. Hitherto 
you have not asked any thing in my 
name: Ask, and you shall receive, that 
your joy may be full. These things I 
have spoken to you in proverbs. The 
hour cometh when I will no more speak
to you in proverbs, but I will show you 
plainly of the Father. In that day you 
shall ask in My name; and I say not to 
you that I will ask the Father for you: for
the Father Himself loveth you, because
you have loved Me and have believed 
that I came out from God. I came forth 
from the Father and am come into the 
world; again I leave the world and I go 
to the Father. His disciples say to Him: 
Behold, now Thou speakest plainly and
speakest no proverb. Now we know 
that Thou knowest all things and Thou 
needest not that any man should ask of
Thee: by this we believe that Thou 
camest forth from God.
