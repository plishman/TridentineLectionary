O God, who on this day, through Thine 
only-begotten Son, hast conquered 
death, and thrown open to us the gate 
of everlasting life, give effect by Thine 
aid to our desires, which Thou dost 
anticipate and inspire. Through the 
same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, 
Who lives and reigns with Thee in the 
unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever 
and ever.
