Throughout this paschal week the Roman Liturgy is entirely absorbed by 
two great thoughts, that of the Resurrection of Our Lord and that of the Baptism 
of the neophytes. These are, as it were, two mysteries which mutually complete
and explain each other. Each is a symbol of the other; the one is the 
prototype,the other the antitype; but neither can be understood if considered by 
itself, for the regeneration of souls to the life of grace through the sacrament of 
Baptism, after a spiritual manner which yet is full of reality, is a new Resurrection
of Christ in His Mystical Body.
