Pour forth upon us, O Lord, the spirit of 
Thy love, that, by Thy loving-kindness, 
thou mayest make to be of one mind 
those whom Thou hast satisfied with 
the Paschal Sacraments. Through the 
same Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
