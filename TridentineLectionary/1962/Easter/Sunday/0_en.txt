I arose and am still with thee, alleluia: 
Thou hast laid Thy hand upon me, 
alleluia; Thy knowledge is become 
wonderful, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 138: 1,
2) Lord, Thou hast searched me, and 
known me; Thou knowest my sitting 
down and my rising up. Glory be to the
Father and to the Son and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. I arose and am still with 
thee, alleluia: Thou hast laid Thy hand 
upon me, alleluia; Thy knowledge is 
become wonderful, alleluia, alleluia.
