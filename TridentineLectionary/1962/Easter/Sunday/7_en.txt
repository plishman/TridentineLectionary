We beseech Thee, O Lord, accept the 
prayers of Thy people together with the
Sacrifice they offer, that what has been 
begun by the Paschal Mysteries, by 
Thy working may profit us unto eternal 
healing. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
