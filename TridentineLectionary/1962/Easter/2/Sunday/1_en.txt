O God, Who, by the humility of Thy 
Son didst lift up a fallen world, grant 
unending happiness to Thy faithful: that
those whom Thou hast snatched from 
the perils of endless death, Thou 
mayest cause to rejoice in everlasting 
joys. Through the same Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, our Lord, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
