Dearly beloved, Christ suffered for us, 
leaving you an example, that you 
should follow His steps who did no sin, 
neither was guile found in His mouth. 
Who when He was reviled, did not 
revile: when He suffered, He 
threatened not, but delivered Himself to
him that judged Him unjustly: who His 
own self bore our sins in His body upon
the tree: that we, being dead to sins, 
should live in justice; by whose stripes 
you were healed. For you were as 
sheep going stray: but you are now 
converted to the Shepherd and Bishop 
of your souls.
