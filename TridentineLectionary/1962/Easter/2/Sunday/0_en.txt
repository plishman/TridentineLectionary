The earth is full of the mercy of the 
Lord, alleluia: by the word of the Lord 
were the heavens made, alleluia, 
alleluia. (Ps.32: 1) Rejoice in the Lord, 
O ye righteous: praise is comely for the
upright. Glory be to the Father, and to 
the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. The
earth is full of the mercy of the Lord, 
alleluia: by the word of the Lord were 
the heavens made, alleluia, alleluia.
