On this Sunday St. Gregory the Great delivered his magnificent homily on 
the Gospel of the Good Shepherd, near the tomb of the first universal pastor. 
Christ founded the papal primacy on the unshakable faith and intense love of 
Peter; and he, following in his Savior's steps, did not hesitate to give his life for 
the flock entrusted to him. The devotion to Jesus the Redeemer under the 
figure of the Good Shepherd was dear to the faithful from very early times; in the
catacombs Christ is frequently represented as a shepherd. The liturgical and 
traditional use of the Gospel of the Good Shepherd on the second Sunday after 
Easter is very old. Jesus, therefore, presents Himself to us today as the "Good 
Shepherd" and tells us what will henceforth be His relationship with His flock. Of
those outside the fold Our Lord speaks gently; not a word of reproach but 
merely a statement of facts.
