At that time Jesus said to His disciples: 
I go to Him that sent Me: and none of 
you asketh Me: Whither goest Thou? 
But because I have spoken these 
things to you, sorrow hath filled your 
heart. But I tell you the truth: it is 
expedient to you that I go: for if I go 
not, the Paraclete will not come to you: 
but if I go, I will send Him to you. And 
when He is come, He will convince the 
world of sin, and of justice and of 
judgment. Of sin, because they 
believed not in Me: of justice, because I
go to the Father, and you shall see Me 
no longer: of judgment, because the 
prince of this world is already judged. I 
have yet many things to say to you; but
you cannot bear them now. But when 
He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will 
teach you all truth. For He shall not 
speak of Himself: but what things 
soever He shall hear He shall speak, 
and the things that are to come, He 
shall show you. He shall glorify Me: 
because He shall receive of Mine and 
shall show it to you.
