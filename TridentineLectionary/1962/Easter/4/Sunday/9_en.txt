Be present with us, O Lord, our God, 
that by means of these things which we
have received in faith, we may be 
cleansed from our sins and also 
delivered from all dangers. Through the
same Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
