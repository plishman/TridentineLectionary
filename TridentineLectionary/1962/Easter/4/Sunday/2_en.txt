Dearly beloved, every best gift and 
every perfect gift is from above, coming
down from the Father of lights, with 
whom there is no change nor shadow 
of alteration; for of His own will hath he 
begotten us by the word of truth, that 
we might be some beginning of His 
creatures. You know, my dearest 
brethren. And let every man be swift to
hear but slow to speak and slow to 
anger. For the anger of a man worketh 
not the justice of God. Wherefore, 
casting away all uncleanness and 
abundance of malice, with meekness 
receive the ingrafted word, which is 
able to save your souls.
