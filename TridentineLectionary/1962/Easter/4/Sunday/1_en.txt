O God, Who makest the faithful to be of
one mind and will: grant to Thy people 
to love that which Thou dost command 
and to desire that which Thou dost 
promise, that amid the changes of the 
world,our hearts may there be fixed 
where true joys are to be found. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
