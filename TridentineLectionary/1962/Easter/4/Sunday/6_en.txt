O God, Who by the holy intercourse of 
this Sacrifice dost make us partakers of
the One Supreme Godhead: grant, we 
beseech Thee, that as we know Thy 
truth, so we may follow it by worthy 
lives. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
