Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle, 
alleluia, for the Lord hath done 
wonderful things, alleluia; He hath 
revealed His justice in the sight of the 
Gentiles, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 
97: 1) His right hand, and His holy arm,
hath gotten Him the victory. Glory be to
the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, 
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen. Sing ye to the Lord a new 
canticle, alleluia, for the Lord hath done
wonderful things, alleluia; He hath 
revealed His justice in the sight of the 
Gentiles, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
