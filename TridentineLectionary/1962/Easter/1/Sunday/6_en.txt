Graciously receive, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord, the gifts of Thine exultant 
Church: and to whom Thou hast 
afforded cause for such joy, grant also 
the fruit of everlasting gladness. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
