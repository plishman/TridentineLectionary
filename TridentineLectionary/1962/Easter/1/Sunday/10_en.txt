We beseech Thee, O Lord our God, to 
make profitable to us, both in this world
and in that to come, the sacred 
mysteries by Thee established for the 
ensuring of our salvation. Through the 
same Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
