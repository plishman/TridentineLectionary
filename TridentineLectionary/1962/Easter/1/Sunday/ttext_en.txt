Low Sunday, so-called in English, by contrast with Easter or High Sunday, is
known in the Liturgy as Dominica in Albis, the Sunday of the laying aside of the 
white robes; for in early ages it was on the evening before this Sunday that the 
neophytes, or converts, baptized together on Holy Saturday and then solemnly 
robed in white, the color symbolical of the innocence recovered by them through
the grace of the sacrament, returned to the use of the ordinary habiliments of 
civil life.
The Gospel recalls the institution of the Sacrament of Penance. It was fitting
that the Lord should on the very day of the Resurrection institute that sacrament
which takes away sorrow and mourning in this world and calls sinners to a new 
life of sanctity. In memory of that fact Catholic tradition still imposes on the 
faithful the duty of receiving absolution from a priest before receiving their 
Easter Communion.
