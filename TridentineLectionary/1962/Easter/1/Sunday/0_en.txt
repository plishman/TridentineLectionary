As newborn babes, alleluia, desire the 
rational milk without guile, alleluia, 
alleluia, alleluia. (Ps. 80: 2) Rejoice to 
God our helper: sing aloud to the God 
of Jacob. Glory be to the Father, and 
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. As 
newborn babes, alleluia, desire the 
rational milk without guile, alleluia, 
alleluia, alleluia.
