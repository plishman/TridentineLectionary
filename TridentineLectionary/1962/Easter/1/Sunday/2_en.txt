Dearly beloved: Whatsoever is born of 
God overcometh the world; and this is 
the victory which overcometh the world,
our faith. Who is he that overcometh 
the world, but he that believeth that 
Jesus is the Son of God? This is He 
that came by water and blood, Jesus 
Christ; not by water only, but by water 
and blood. And it is the Spirit which 
testifieth that Christ is the truth. And 
there are three who give testimony in 
heaven: the Father, the Word, and the 
Holy Spirit: and these three are one. 
And there are three that give testimony 
on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the 
blood: and these three are one. If we 
receive the testimony of men, the 
testimony of God is greater: for this is 
the testimony of God, which is greater, 
because He hath testified of His Son. 
He that believeth in the Son of God 
hath the testimony of God in himself.
