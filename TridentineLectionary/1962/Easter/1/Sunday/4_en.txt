At that time, when it was late that same
day, the first of the week, and the doors
were shut, where the disciples were 
gathered together for fear of the Jews, 
Jesus came, and stood in the midst 
and said to them: Peace be to you. And
when He had said this, He showed 
them His hands and His side. The 
disciples therefore were glad, when 
they saw the Lord. He said therefore to 
them again: Peace be to you: as the 
Father hath sent Me, I also send you. 
When He had said this, He breathed on
them, and He said to them, Receive ye 
the Holy Spirit: whose sins you shall 
forgive, they are forgiven them, and 
whose sins you shall retain, they are 
retained. Now Thomas, one of the 
twelve, who is called Didymus, was not 
with them when Jesus came. The other
disciples therefore said to him: We 
have seen the Lord. But he said to 
them: â€œExcept I shall see in His hands 
the print of the nails, and put my finger 
into the place of the nails, and put my 
hand into His side, I will not believe. 
And after eight days, again His 
disciples were within, and Thomas with 
them. Jesus cometh, the doors being 
shut, and stood in the midst, and said: 
Peace be to you. Then He saith to 
Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and 
see My hands, and bring hither thy 
hand, and put it into My side; and be 
not faithless, but believing. Thomas 
answered, and said to him: My Lord 
and my God. Jesus saith to him: 
Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, 
thou hast believed: blessed are they 
that have not seen and have believed. 
Many other signs also did Jesus in the 
sight of His disciples which are not 
written in this book. But these are 
written, that you may believe that Jesus
is the Christ the Son of God; and that, 
believing, you may have life in His 
name.
