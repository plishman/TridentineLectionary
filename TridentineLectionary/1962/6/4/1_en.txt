O God, Who didst adorn blessed 
Francis, as the founder of a new order, 
with the spirit of prayer and the love of 
penance, grant Thy servants to make 
such progress in imitating him that, by 
prayer without ceasing, and by bringing
the body into subjection, they may 
deserve to attain heavenly glory. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
