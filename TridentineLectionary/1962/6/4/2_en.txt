The just man, if he be prevented with 
death, shall be in rest. For venerable 
age is not that of long time, nor counted
by the number of years; but the 
understanding of a man is gray hairs. 
And a spotless life is old age. He 
pleased God and was beloved, and 
living among sinners he was translated.
He was taken away lest wickedness 
should alter his understanding, or 
deceit beguile his soul. For the 
bewitching of vanity obscureth good 
things, and the wandering of 
concupiscence overturneth the 
innocent mind. Being made perfect in a
short space, he fulfilled a long time. For
his soul pleased God: therefore He 
hastened to bring him out of the midst 
of iniquities.
