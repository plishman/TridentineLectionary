St. Francis Caracciolo, born in the kingdom of Naples; was one of the 
founders of the Order of Clerks Regular, who in turn watched in perpetual 
adoration before the Blessed Sacrament. His short life of forty years was 
profitable in the sight of God. He edified by his holy life, not only Naples and 
Rome, but also distant Spain. He died on June 4, 1608, and was canonized by 
Pope Pius VII.
