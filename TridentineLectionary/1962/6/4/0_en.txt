My heart is become like wax melting in 
the midst of my bowels: for the zeal of 
Thy house hath eaten me up. (Ps. 72: 
1) How good is God to Isr«Ωl: to them 
that are of a right heart. Glory be to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is 
now, and ever shall be, world without 
end. Amen. My heart is become like 
wax melting in the midst of my bowels: 
for the zeal of Thy house hath eaten 
me up.
