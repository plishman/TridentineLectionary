Let the happy memory of the most holy 
sacrifice, which we have this day 
offered to Thy majesty on the solemn 
feast of blessed Francis, ever endure in
our minds together with its fruits. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
