Sts. John and Paul were both Christian officers in the army under Julian the 
Apostate. They suffered martyrdom in their own house, on the Crellan Hill. They 
spent ten days allowed them to deliberate about renouncing their devotion to 
Christ in distributing all their goods to the poor. The fact that, unlike other 
martyrs who were buried outside the walls, they had their place of burial in the 
very heart of the Eternal City, was looked upon by the early Christians as a 
special honor granted to them and to Rome by Divine Providence. Archeological
discoveries have fully confirmed the truth of the Acts of their martyrdom. Their 
dwelling-house, the place of their execution, the graves, and important paintings
have been brought to light. The two brothers when on earth possessed one 
home and one Faith, and now in heaven possess the same immortal crown.
