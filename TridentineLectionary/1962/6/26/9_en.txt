We have partaken of Thy heavenly 
sacrament, O Lord, celebrating the 
feast of Thy holy martyrs John and 
Paul; grant, we beseech Thee, that 
what we do in this life may have its 
consequences in everlasting joys. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
