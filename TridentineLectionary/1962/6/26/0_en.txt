Many were the afflictions of the just, 
and out of all these the Lord delivered 
them: the Lord keepeth all their bones, 
not one of them shall be broken. (Ps. 
33: 2) I will bless the Lord at all times: 
His praise shall be ever in my mouth. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, 
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Many were 
the afflictions of the just, and out of all 
these the Lord delivered them: the Lord
keepeth all their bones, not one of them
shall be broken.
