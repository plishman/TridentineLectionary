We beseech Thee, O almighty God, 
that the double joy of this day's festival,
which proceedeth from the glory of 
blessed John and Paul, kindred 
through the one faith and the one 
martyrdom, may take possession of us.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
