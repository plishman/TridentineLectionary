Grant, O Lord, that we who have been 
fed with the food of Angels, may also 
live the lives of Angels: and after the 
example of him whom we honor this 
day, always continue to give thanks 
unto Thee. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
