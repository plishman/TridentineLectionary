Thou hast made him a little less than 
the Angels: Thou hast crowned him 
with glory and honor. (Ps. 148: 2) 
Praise ye the Lord, all His Angels: 
praise ye Him, all His hosts. Glory be 
to the Father, and to the Son, and to 
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. Thou hast 
made him a little less than the Angels: 
Thou hast crowned him with glory and 
honor.
