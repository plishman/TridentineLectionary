Make us, O Lord, to sit down to Thy
Heavenly banquet clothed in the 
wedding garment which the pious 
preparation and constant tears of 
blessed Aloysius adorned with 
priceless pearls. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
