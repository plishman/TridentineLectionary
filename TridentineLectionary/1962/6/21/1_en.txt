O God, the dispenser of Heavenly gifts,
Who in the angelic youth Aloysius didst 
combine wonderful innocence of life 
with penance, grant by his merits and 
prayers that we, who have not followed 
him in innocence, may imitate his 
penance. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
