Blessed is the man that is found 
without blemish, and that hath not gone
after gold, nor put his trust in money 
nor in treasures. Who is he, and we 
will praise him? for he hath done 
wonderful things in his life. Who hath 
been tried thereby, and made
perfect, he shall have glory 
everlasting: he that could have 
transgressed, and hath not 
transgressed: and could do evil things, 
and hath not done them: therefore are 
his goods established in the Lord.
