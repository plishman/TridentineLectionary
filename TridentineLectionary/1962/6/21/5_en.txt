At that time, Jesus answering, said to 
the Sadducees: You err, not knowing 
the Scriptures, nor the power of God. 
For in the resurrection they shall 
neither marry nor be married: but shall 
be as Angels of God in heaven. And 
concerning the resurrection of the 
dead, have you not read that which 
was spoken by God, saying to you: I
am the God of Abraham, and the God 
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is 
not the God of the dead, but of the 
living. And the multitudes hearing it 
were in admiration of His doctrine. But 
the Pharisees, hearing that He had 
silenced the Sadducee s, came 
together: and one of them, a doctor of 
the law, asked Him, tempting Him: 
Master, which is the great 
commandment of the law? Jesus said 
to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy 
God with thy whole heart, and with thy 
whole mind. This is the greatest and 
the first commandment. And the 
second is like to this: Thou shalt love 
thy neighbor as thyself. Of these two 
commandments dependeth the whole 
law and the prophets.
