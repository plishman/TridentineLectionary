This saint was like a white and fragrant lily in his virgin purity, transplanted 
by God from the luxurious and sensual Court of Madrid to the chosen garden of 
St. Ignatius of Loyola at Rome. The whole life of Aloysius breathes forth sanctity 
and purity; his Baptism, which was administered at the very moment of his birth,
his first Communion at the hands of St. Charles Borromeo; his reception into the
Society of Jesus by Claudio Acquaviva, the spiritual direction given to him at 
the Collegio Romano by St. Robert Bellarmine; his severe penances, and, lastly,
his holy death as a victim of charity in the service of the plague-stricken 
sufferers in the Hospital of the Consolazione at Rome. He died on the octave- 
day of Corpus Christi, 1591, at the age of twenty-three years. Benedict XIII 
declared him the patron of young people.
