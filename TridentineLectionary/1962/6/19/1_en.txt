O God, Who didst vouchsafe 
miraculously to restore blessed Juliana,
Thy virgin, with the precious body of 
Thy Son, when she suffered with a 
mortal sickness, grant, we beseech 
Thee, by her merits interceding for us, 
we, too, being refreshed and 
strengthened by the same in the agony 
of death, may be brought to our 
heavenly country. Through the same 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.

<i>(Commemoration of Sts. Gervase & 
Protase)</i>
<br>
O God, Who dost gladden us by the 
annual solemnity of Thy martyrs, 
Gervase and Protase, mercifully grant 
that we be kindled by the example of 
those in whose merits we rejoice. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
