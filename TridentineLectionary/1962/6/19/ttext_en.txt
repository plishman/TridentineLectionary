St. Juliana Falconieri, born in Florence in 1270, niece of St. Alexis 
Falconieri, even as a child showed such sanctity that her holy uncle told her 
mother that she had given birth to an angel. To hear sin spoken of made her 
tremble. At the age of fifteen she consecrated her virginity to God. She founded 
the Order of the Mantelette (wearers of a short cloak or mantle); she was then 
asked by St. Philip Beniti to take charge of the whole order of the Servites and 
thus may be regarded as a second foundress of this Community devoted to the 
Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin. Toward the end of her life; on account of constant
sickness, it was not possible for her to receive the Blessed Sacrament; she 
asked that it might be held near her heart. When this was done the sacred host 
miraculously penetrated her breast. She died on June 19,1340. In olden times 
the pagans placed in the mouth of the dead a piece of money as payment to the
boatman Charon. In the Fourth Century it was already an ancient tradition of the
Roman Church to comfort the last moments of the faithful by administration of 
the Eucharist; the Viaticum also was sometimes placed on the breast of the 
dead person. This custom which testified to the robust faith of that early age in 
the immortality of the soul and final resurrection was afterwards modified by the 
Church, decreeing that Communion after Confession and Extreme Unction 
should suffice as Viaticum.
Commemoration of Sts. Gervase & Protase: Sts. Gervase and Protase, said
to be twins, were called by St. Ambrose the proto-martyrs of Milan. At the close 
of the Fourth Century he discovered their relics and had them suitably 
enshrined.
Their names are included in the Litany of the Saints.
