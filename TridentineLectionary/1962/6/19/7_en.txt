May the offering of Thy consecrated 
people be accepted by Thee, O Lord, in
honor of Thy saints, by whose merits it 
knoweth that it hath received aid in time
of trouble. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

Be appeased O Lord, with the gifts we 
offer,and, by the intercession of Thy 
holy martyrs, defend us from all 
dangers. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
