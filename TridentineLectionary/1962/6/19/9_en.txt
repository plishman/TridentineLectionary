Thou hast filled Thy household, O Lord,
with sacred gifts; ever comfort us, we 
beseech Thee, through her 
intercession whose festival we 
celebrate. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

<i>(Commemoration of Sts. Gervase & 
Protase)</i>
<br>
May this communion, O Lord, purge us 
of guilt and, by the intercession of Thy 
holy martyrs, Gervase and Protase, 
make us partakers of the heavenly 
salvation. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
