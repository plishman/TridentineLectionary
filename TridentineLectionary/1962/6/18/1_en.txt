O God, who didst will to illumine Thy 
Church by the wondrous learning and 
glorious merits of blessed Ephrem, Thy
Confessor and Doctor, do Thou, we 
humbly entreat Thee, by his 
intercession and Thy continual power, 
defend her against the wiles of heresy 
and wickedness. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.

<i>(Commemoration of Sts. Mark & 
Marcellianus, Martyrs.)</i>
<br>
Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty 
God, that we who observe the natal 
feast of Thy holy Martyrs, Mark and 
Marcellianus, may by their intercession 
be delivered from all the evils that 
threaten us. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
