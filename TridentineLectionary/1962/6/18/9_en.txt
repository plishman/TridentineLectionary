We beseech Thee, O Lord, that 
blessed Ephrem, Thy Confessor and 
illustrious Doctor, may approach to pray
for us, that these Thy sacrifices may 
bring us salvation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.

<i>(Commemoration of Sts. Mark & 
Marcellianus, Martyrs.)</i>
<br>
Refreshed by the sacramental gift of 
Thy salvation, we humbly entreat Thee,
O Lord, through the intercession of 
blessed Mark and Marcellianus, Thy 
Martyrs, that, enjoying its savor, we 
may be made new by its action. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
