O Lord, may the loving prayer of 
blessed Ephrem, Thy Confessor and 
Doctor, fail us not, both to make our 
gifts acceptable and ever to obtain for 
us Thy forgiveness. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.

<i>(Commemoration of Sts. Mark & 
Marcellianus, Martyrs.)</i>
<br>
Sanctify the offerings dedicated to 
Thee, O Lord, and, by the intercessions
of blessed Mark and Marcellianus, Thy 
Martyrs, look favorably upon us through
them. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Thy Son, Who lives and reigns with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
