St. Ephrem born at Nisibis in Mesopotamia of a pagan father, was cast out 
of his home and lived as a hermit in the desert. He never became a priest but 
was deacon of the Church of Edessa. From early times, because of his 
opposition to the Arians, he had been famed as a teacher of the Universal 
Church; not only the Syrians, but the Byzantines, the Slavs, the Armenians, and 
the Copts had incorporated in their liturgical books the melodious compositions 
of the celebrated Deacon of Edessa, who was called in consequence by the 
Eastern Church the "Lyre of the Holy Spirit." He died at Edessa in 379. In 1918, 
the year in which the Centenary of St. Jerome was being kept, Pope Benedict 
XV compared these two heroic monks of the East. On October 5, 1920, this 
same Pope proclaimed St. Ephrem a Doctor of the Church. He is the only 
Deacon honored with the title of Doctor.
Commemoration of Sts. Mark & Marcellianus, Martyrs: Sts. Mark and 
Marcellianus were twin brothers of an illustrious family in Rome. They gave 
their lives for Christ in 286, under the persecutions of Diocletian, after suffering 
cruel torture.
