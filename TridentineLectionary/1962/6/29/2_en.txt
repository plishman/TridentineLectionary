In those days, Herod the king stretched
forth his hands to afflict some of the 
Church: and he killed James, the 
brother of John, with the sword; and 
seeing that it pleased the Jews, he 
proceeded to take up Peter also. Now it
was in the days of the Azymes: and 
when he had apprehended him, he 
cast him into prison, delivering him to 
four files of soldiers to be kept, 
intending after the pasch to bring him 
forth to the people. Peter therefore was
kept in prison: but prayer was made 
without ceasing by the Church unto 
God for him. And when Herod would 
have brought him forth, the same night 
Peter was sleeping between two 
soldiers, bound with two chains; and 
the keepers before the door kept the 
prison: and behold an angel of the Lord
stood by him, and a light shined in the 
room and he striking Peter on the side, 
raised him up, saying, Arise quickly; 
and the chains fell off from his hands: 
and the angel said to him, Gird, thyself 
and put on thy sandals; and he did so: 
and he said to him, Cast thy garment 
about thee and follow me: and going 
out he followed him: and he knew not 
that it was true which was done by the 
angel; but he thought he saw a vision. 
And passing through the first and the 
second ward, they came to the iron 
gate that leadeth to the city, which of 
itself opened to them; and going out, 
they passed on through one street, and
immediately the angel departed from 
him. And Peter coming to himself, said, 
Now I know in very deed that the Lord 
hath sent His angel, and hath delivered
me out of the hand of Herod, and from 
all the expectation of the people of the 
Jews.
