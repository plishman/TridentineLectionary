May the prayer of Thine apostles, O 
Lord, accompany the sacrifices which 
we offer to be consecrated to Thy 
name, and through it do Thou grant us 
to be pardoned and defended. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ Thy Son our 
Lord, Who lives and reigns with Thee in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
