O God, Who hast consecrated this day 
to the martyrdom of Thine apostles 
Peter and Paul, grant to Thy Church in 
all things to follow their teaching from 
whom it received the right ordering of 
religion in the beginning. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
