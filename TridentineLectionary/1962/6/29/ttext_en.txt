On June 29, A.D. 67, St. Peter was crucified, head downward, by order of 
Nero, on a hill overlooking the Vatican. On the same day, St. Paul was 
beheaded outside one of the gates of Rome. The Romans celebrated this feast 
with splendor equal to, if not surpassing, that of Easter. There are two stations, 
the one at St. Peter's, the other at St. Paul's, but in both Masses the Collects 
are common to the two apostles indissolubly united in a single prayer. It is just 
because of this ancient feeling, which is common not only to the Romans but to 
all the Fathers, that the two founders of the Roman Church can never be 
divided.
Tradition has preserved the memory of the places in which St. Peter and St.
Paul dwelt. It is certain the chair of St. Peter and the chains of St. Paul were 
carefully guarded. The Vatican Basilica is erected over the burial place of St. 
Peter; the Ostian Basilica, St. Paul's-Outslde-the-Walls, honors the
Apostle of the Gentiles.
