Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, 
His mother, and His mother's sister, 
Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen.
When Jesus therefore had seen His 
mother and the disciple standing whom
He loved, He saith to His mother: 
Woman, behold thy son. After that, He 
saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother.
And from that hour, the disciple took 
her to his own.
