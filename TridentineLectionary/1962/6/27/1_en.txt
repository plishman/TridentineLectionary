Almighty and merciful God, Who hast 
given us a picture of Thy most blessed 
Mother to venerate under the special 
title of Perpetual Succor, mercifully 
grant us to be so fortified, among all the
vicissitudes of this wayfaring life, by the
protection of the same immaculate, 
ever virgin Mary, that we may deserve 
to attain the rewards of Thine 
everlasting redemption. Who lives and 
reigns with God the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
