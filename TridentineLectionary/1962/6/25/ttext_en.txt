The feast of the founder of the Solitaries of Monte Vergine was inserted in 
the Calendar of the Universal Church by Leo XIII. This monastic Congregation 
was widely diffused at one time in the South of Italy, but having greatly 
decreased in numbers it was amalgamated in the second half of the Nineteenth 
Century, with the Benedictines of Subiaco.
St. William, who died in 1142, was noted for the austerity of his life and for 
his great gentleness towards others. His body rests now on the summit of the 
Parthenius, in the Basilica of Our Lady which he built, and where every year 
many thousands of pilgrims assemble to do honor to the Blessed Virgin.
