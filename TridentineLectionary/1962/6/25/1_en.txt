O God, Who hast set for us in Thy 
saints an example and a help for our 
weakness; to assist us to tread the path
of salvation, grant us so to venerate the
virtues of the blessed Abbot William 
that we may share in his prayers and 
follow in his footsteps. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
