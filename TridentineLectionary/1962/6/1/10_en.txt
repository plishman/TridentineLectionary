Refreshed with this heavenly food, we
humbly beseech Thee, O Lord, that by 
the prayers and example of blessed 
Angela, we may be cleansed from all 
sin, and become pleasing to Thee both 
in body and mind. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
