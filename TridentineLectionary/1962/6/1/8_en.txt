May the sacrifice, O Lord, which we 
offer Thee in remembrance of blessed 
Angela, both implore for us the pardon

Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and

destroyed our death: and by rising 
again hath restored us to life. And 
therefore with Angels and Archangels, 
with Thrones and Dominations, and 
with all the hosts of the heavenly army, 
we sing the hymn of Thy glory, 
evermore saying:

Angels and Archangels, with the 
Thrones and Dominations, and with all 
the hosts of the heavenly army, we sing
the hymn of Thy glory, evermore 
saying:
