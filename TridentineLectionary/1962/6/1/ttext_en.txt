The feast of the foundress of the Ursulines under the rule of the Third Order 
of St. Francis was inserted in the Calendar of the Universal Church by Pius IX 
in 1861. The devout pilgrimages of St. Angela to the Holy Land and to Rome 
recall, in a manner, those made by St. Bridget of Sweden some two centuries
earlier. She showed the same faith and enjoyed equal respect with the Popes, 
so much so that Clement VII would not allow her to leave the Eternal City. After 
having brought together a band of holy women, who devoted themselves to the
Christian education of girls, St. Angela passed away from this life, full of merits, 
on January 27, 1540.
