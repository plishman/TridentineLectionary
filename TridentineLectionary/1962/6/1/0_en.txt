Thou hast loved justice, and hated 
iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath 
anointed thee with the oil of gladness 
above thy fellows. (P.T. Alleluia, 
alleluia.) (Ps. 44: 2) My heart hath 
uttered a good word: I speak my works 
to the King. Glory be to the Father, and 
to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it 
was in the beginning, is now, and ever 
shall be, world without end. Amen. 
Thou hast loved justice, and hated 
iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath 
anointed thee with the oil of gladness 
above thy fellows. (P.T. Alleluia, 
alleluia.)
