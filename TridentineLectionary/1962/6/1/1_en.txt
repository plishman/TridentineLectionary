O God, Who through blessed Angela
didst cause a new society of holy 
virgins to flourish in Thy Church; grant 
through her intercession, that living 
angelic lives, and by detaching our 
hearts from earthly joys, we may merit 
to enjoy those that are eternal. Through
our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who 
lives and reigns with Thee in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
