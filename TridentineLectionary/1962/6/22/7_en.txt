Grant us, O Lord, to join the sacrifice of
perfect charity with the oblation of the 
altar, after the example of the holy 
bishop Paulinus, and, by zeal for good 
works, to deserve everlasting mercy. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
