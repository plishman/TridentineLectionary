Grant us, O Lord, by these holy things 
that sentiment of piety and humility 
which Thy holy bishop Paulinus drew 
from the same divine source, and by 
his intercession benignly pour the 
riches of Thy grace upon all who call 
upon Thee. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
