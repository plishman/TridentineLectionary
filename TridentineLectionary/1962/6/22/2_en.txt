Brethren, Ye know the grace of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich He 
became poor for your sakes; that 
through His poverty ye might be rich. 
And herein, I give my counsel: for this 
is profitable for you, who have begun 
not only to do, but also to be willing, a 
year ago; now therefore perform it also 
in deed: that as your mind is forward to 
be willing, so it may be also to perform, 
out of that which ye have. For if the will 
be forward, to be willing, so it may be 
also to perform, out of that which ye 
have. For if the will be forward, it is 
accepted according to that which a 
man hath, not according to which he 
hath not. For I mean not that others 
should be eased, and you burthened, 
but by an equality. In this present time 
let your abundance supply their want, 
that their abundance also may supply 
your want; that there may be an 
equality, as it is written: He that hath 
much had nothing over; and he that 
had little had no want.
