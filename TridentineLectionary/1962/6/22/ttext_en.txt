St. Paulinus was Bishop of Nola in Southern Italy. So great was his charity 
that he sold himself into slavery in order to ransom the son of a poor widow, who
had been carried off by the Vandals of Africa. He was afterward set free, and 
returned to Nola, where he died in 431. Otho III brought his body from 
Beneventum to the little island in the Tiber near the Trastevere. Pius X had 
them carried back in triumph to his episcopal city at Nola, and ordered a new 
Mass in his honor to be inserted in the Missal and his feast raised to a double in 
the Universal Church. His figure is one of the most attractive of ancient times. 
Without leaving his monastic retreat he exerted great influence on his times; he 
was not a man of action, but of prayer, given to solitude and a lover of poetry 
and fine arts.
