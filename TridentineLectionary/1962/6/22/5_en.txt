At that time, Jesus said to His disciples:
Fear not, little flock, for it hath pleased 
your Father to give you a kingdom. Sell
what you possess, and give alms. 
Make to yourselves bags which grow 
not old, a treasure in Heaven which 
faileth not: where no thief approacheth, 
nor moth corrupteth - for where your 
treasure is, there will your heart be 
also.
