O God, Who hast promised to those 
who leave all in this world for Thee a 
hundred-fold in the world to come and 
life everlasting, mercifully grant that, 
following closely in the footsteps of the 
holy bishop, Paulinus, we may have the
grace to despise earthly things and 
desire only Heavenly. Who lives and 
reigns with God the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and 
ever.
