St. Boniface was a native of Devonshire, England. His first attempt to 
convert pagans having failed, he went to Rome where he received the Pope's 
blessing on his mission, and then set forth with the papal authority to preach to 
the German tribes. He thus became the apostle and first archbishop of the 
Germans. While engaged in his earnest work he, with other Christians, sutfered
martyrdom, on June 5, 755. Pius IX extended the Office of St. Boniface to the 
whole Church.
