Partaking of the sufferings of Christ, 
rejoice, that when His glory shall be 
revealed, you may also be glad with 
exceeding joy. If you be reproached for
the name of Christ, you shall be 
blessed: for that which is of the honor, 
glory, and power of God, and that 
which is His spirit resteth upon you.
