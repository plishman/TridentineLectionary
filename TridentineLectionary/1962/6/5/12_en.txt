Sanctified, O Lord, by this saving 
mystery, we beseech Thee that the 
loving prayer of St. Boniface, Thy 
martyr and bishop, by whose patronage
Thou hast given us to be governed, 
may never be wanting. Through our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives 
and reigns with Thee in the unity of the 
Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.
