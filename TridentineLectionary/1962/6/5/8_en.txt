Let Thy plenteous blessing descend 
upon these offerings, O Lord, both 
mercifully to work our sanctification and
to make us rejoice in the solemnity of 
St. Boniface, Thy martyr and bishop. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with Thee in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
