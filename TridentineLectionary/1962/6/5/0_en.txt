I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my
people, and the voice of weeping shall 
no more be heard in her, nor the voice 
of crying. My elect shall not labor in 
vain, nor bring forth in trouble: for they 
are the seed of the blessed of the Lord,
and their posterity with them (P.T. 
Alleluia, alleluia.). (Ps. 43: 2) We 
have heard, O God, with our ears: our 
fathers have declared to us the work 
Thou hast wrought in their days. Glory 
be to the Father and to the Son and to 
the Holy Ghost, as it was in the 
beginning, is now and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. I will rejoice 
in Jerusalem, and joy in my people, 
and the voice of weeping shall no more
be heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 
My elect shall not labor in vain, nor 
bring forth in trouble: for they are the 
seed of the blessed of the Lord, and 
their posterity with them. (P.T. Alleluia, 
alleluia.)
