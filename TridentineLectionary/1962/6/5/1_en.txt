O God, Who didst vouchsafe to call a 
multitude of peoples to the knowledge 
of Thy name by means of the zeal of 
blessed Boniface, Thy martyr and 
bishop, mercifully grant that, as we 
venerate his festival, we may 
experience the benefits of his 
protection. Through our Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and reigns 
with Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
