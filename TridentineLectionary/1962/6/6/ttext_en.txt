St. Norbert, archbishop of Magdeburg, in North Germany, was the founder of
the Canons Regular or Premonstratensians, as they were called. The doctrine of
the Real Presence having been questioned by Tanchelin of Antwerp, Norbert, 
who was distinguished for his devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, reclaimed
many who had fallen away, and rekindled the love of Our Lord in the Blessed 
Eucharist. His order takes its name from Premontre where it was founded. The 
chief characteristic of the mission of St. Norbert was his eloquent preaching of 
the word of God. This is an entirely apostolic mission which is not always 
appreciated as much as it should be. The preaching of the Gospel is indeed a 
most necessary thing, for no man can believe the Word of God and be saved 
except there be an apostle to preach it to him. He died in 1134, worn out with
toil.
