O God, Who didst make blessed 
Norbert, Thy confessor and bishop, an 
excelling preacher of Thy word, and 
through him didst cause Thy Church to 
bring forth a new progeny, grant, we 
beseech Thee, that, by the intercession
of his merits, we may have the 
strength, with Thine assistance, to 
practice what he, both by word and 
work, hath taught us. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
