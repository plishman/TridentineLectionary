O God, Who have willed that Blessed 
Gregory, Your Confessor and Bishop, 
be renowned for the care of his flock 
and compassion for the poor; favorably 
grant that we who honor his merits may
imitate the example of his charity. 
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son, Who lives and reigns with You in 
the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
and ever.
