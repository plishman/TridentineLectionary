Grant, we beseech You, almighty God, 
that as we thank Thee for the favors we
have received, we may, by the 
intercession of blessed Gregory,Thy 
Confessor and Bishop, obtain still 
greater blessings. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reign with You in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
