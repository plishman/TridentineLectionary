Cardinal Barbarigo fostered catechetical instruction and he traveled to each 
village in his diocese in order to teach and to preach to the people. His 
compassion to the poor was well known for he gave his household goods and 
his clothes to the poor for their comfort. He even sold his bed on one occasion 
to help them. He died June 18, 1697, and was canonized by Pope John XXIII in
1960.
