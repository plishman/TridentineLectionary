We heap Thine altars with gifts, O Lord,
celebrating with fitting honor the nativity
of him who heralded the coming of the 
Savior, and pointed Him out when He 
had come, Our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy 
Son: Who lives and reigns with God the
Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
God, forever and ever.
