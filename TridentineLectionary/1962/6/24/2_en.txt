Give ear, ye islands, and harken, ye 
people from afar. The Lord hath called 
me from the womb, from the bowels of 
my mother He hath been mindful of my
name. Arid He hath made my mouth 
like a sharp sword; in the shadow of 
His hand He hath protected me, and 
hath made me as a chosen arrow; in 
His quiver He hath hidden me. And He 
said to me: Thou art My servant Israel, 
for in thee will I glory. And now saith the
Lord that formed me from the womb to 
be His servant: Behold I have given 
thee to be the light of the Gentiles, that 
thou mayest be My salvation even to 
the farthest part of the earth. Kings 
shall see, and princes shall rise up, and
adore for the Lord's sake, and for the 
Holy One of Israel Who hath chosen 
thee.
