The day of the death of other saints is kept as their feast, and in the case of St. 
John the Baptist the day of his birth is celebrated, as having taken place amidst 
the outpouring of the gifts of the Paraclete. The feast is celebrated with great 
liturgical splendor, the stational Mass was celebrated in the Basilica of the 
Saviour. This grandeur of early devotion to the Baptist need cause no one to 
wonder, if we realize the eminent position which St. John holds in the history of 
the Incarnation. His seal of canonization is seen in the eulogy addressed to him
by the Word of God Himself made man, when He pointed him out to the people 
as the greatest among all the prophets, and among all those born of woman, the
new Elias, the burning and shining light.
