O God, Who hast made this day 
honorable to us on account of the birth 
of blessed John, grant Thy people the 
grace of spiritual joys, and direct the 
minds of all the faithful in the way of 
eternal salvation. Through our Lord 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who lives and 
reigns with Thee in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, God, forever and ever.
