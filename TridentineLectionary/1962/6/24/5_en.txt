Elizabeth's full time of being delivered 
was come, and she brought forth a son.
And her neighbors and kinsfolk heard 
that the Lord had showed His great 
mercy towards her, and they 
congratulated with her. And it came to 
pass, that on the eighth day they came
to circumcise the child, and they
called him by his father's name, 
Zachary. And his mother answering, 
said Not so, but he shall be called 
John. And they said to her: There is 
none of thy kindred that is called by 
that name. And they made signs to his 
father, how he would have him called. 
And demanding a writing-table, he
wrote, saying: John is his name: and 
they all wondered. And immediately his 
mouth was opened, and his tongue 
loosed; and he spoke, blessing God. 
And fear came upon all their neighbors;
and all these things were noised 
abroad over all the hill country of 
Judea; and all they that had heard 
them, laid them up in their heart, 
saying: What a one, think ye, shall this 
child be? For the hand of the Lord was
with him. And Zachary his father was 
filled with the Holy Ghost; and he 
prophesied, saying: Blessed be the 
Lord God of Israel; because He hath 
visited, and wrought the redemption of 
His people.
