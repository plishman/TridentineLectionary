From the womb of my mother the Lord
hath called me by my name, and He 
hath made my mouth like a sharp 
sword; in the shadow of His hand He 
hath protected me, and hath made me 
as a chosen arrow. (Ps. 91: 2) It is 
good to give praise to the Lord, and to 
sing to Thy name, O Most High. Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Spirit, as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. From the 
womb of my mother the Lord hath 
called me by my name, and He hath 
made my mouth like a sharp sword; in 
the shadow of His hand He hath 
protected me, and hath made me as a 
chosen arrow.
